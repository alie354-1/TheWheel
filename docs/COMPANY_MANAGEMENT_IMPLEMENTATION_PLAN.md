## User Stories

### 1. Company Profile Management
- **As a company admin, I want to edit the company profile, including logo, banner, and metadata, so that our public presence is accurate.**
- **As a user, I want to view a company profile page with all relevant information and media.**
- **As a company admin, I want to restrict who can edit the profile based on roles.**

### 2. Company Deletion & Archiving
- **As a company owner, I want to delete or archive the company, with clear warnings and the ability to export data.**
- **As an admin, I want to see the impact of deletion before confirming.**

### 3. User Management with Roles
- **As a company admin, I want to add, remove, and manage users with specific roles (admin, member, guest, custom).**
- **As a user, I want to see my role and permissions within the company.**
- **As an admin, I want to invite users by email and track invitation status.**
- **As an owner/admin, I want to transfer ownership to another member.**

### 4. Access Control
- **As a developer, I want a permission system that enforces role-based access at both the API and database level.**
- **As an admin, I want to define custom roles and permissions for my company.**

## Notes

- All changes must be backward compatible where possible.
