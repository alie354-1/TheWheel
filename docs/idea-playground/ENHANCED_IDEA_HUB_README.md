# Enhanced Idea Hub

The Enhanced Idea Hub is a new feature that provides a modern, flexible interface for managing and exploring ideas. It offers multiple view options, improved filtering, and better integration with company features.

## Features

- **Multiple View Options**: Switch between different views of your ideas (Card Grid, Kanban, List, Timeline, etc.)
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter ideas by type, status, company, and more
- **Improved Sorting**: Sort ideas by various criteria
- **Company Integration**: Easily push ideas to company features
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all device sizes

## Components

The Enhanced Idea Hub is built with a modular architecture:

### Core Components

1. **IdeaCard**: Base component for displaying idea information
2. **CardGridView**: Displays ideas in a grid layout
3. **ViewManager**: Manages switching between different view types
4. **EnhancedIdeaHub**: Main page component that integrates all parts

### API Services

- **idea-hub-api.ts**: Handles communication with the backend

### State Management

- **idea-hub-store.ts**: Central state management using Zustand

## How to Access

The Enhanced Idea Hub is available at the following URL:

```
/idea-hub/enhanced
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install-supabase-deps.sh
   ```

2. Make sure the database migrations are applied:
   ```bash
   node scripts/run-enhanced-idea-hub-migration.js
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- Kanban view for workflow management
- List view for compact display
- Timeline view for historical tracking
- Network view for idea relationships
- Focus view for detailed analysis
- Folder view for organization

## Technical Details

The Enhanced Idea Hub uses:

- React for UI components
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for backend communication

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the 406 (Not Acceptable) or 403 (Forbidden) errors when accessing app_settings or logging_sessions, this is likely due to permission issues with the Supabase configuration. These errors are related to the logging system and don't affect the core functionality of the Enhanced Idea Hub.
