# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 17 Implementation Plan

## Sprint Goal

Begin Phase 3: Cross-Domain Intelligence & Decision System. This sprint focuses on implementing the learning system for continuous improvement, enabling cohort-based and company-wide pattern recognition, and enhancing the feedback and reflection mechanisms.

---

## Context

- The platform supports advanced analytics, team collaboration, and knowledge management.
- The feedback and learning system is in place, but not yet leveraging cohort or pattern-based intelligence.
- Reflection and advanced feedback mechanisms are needed for deeper learning and improvement.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 17.1: Learning System for Continuous Improvement

**As** a founder  
**I want** the system to learn from decision patterns and business milestones  
**So that** future suggestions and prioritization improve over time

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Learning System for Continuous Improvement
  Scenario: System learns from decisions and milestones
    Given I make decisions and reach milestones
    When the system processes outcomes and feedback
    Then future recommendations and priorities are adjusted based on learning
```

---

### Story 17.2: Cohort-Based Pattern Recognition

**As** a user  
**I want** the system to recognize and leverage patterns from similar companies (cohorts)  
**So that** I benefit from collective intelligence and best practices

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Cohort-Based Pattern Recognition
  Scenario: Leverage cohort patterns for recommendations
    Given my company is part of a cohort (e.g., industry, stage)
    When the system identifies successful patterns in the cohort
    Then recommendations and insights are surfaced based on those patterns
```

---

### Story 17.3: Advanced Feedback & Reflection Mechanisms

**As** a user  
**I want** to provide structured feedback and reflect on major decisions  
**So that** I can learn and improve my business operations

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Advanced Feedback & Reflection
  Scenario: Provide feedback and reflect on decisions
    Given I complete a major decision or milestone
    When prompted by the system
    Then I can provide structured feedback and reflect on the outcome
    And the system uses this input for future learning
```

---

## Technical Tasks

- Implement the learning system backend to track decision patterns, outcomes, and feedback
- Integrate cohort-based pattern recognition logic and cohort management UI
- Build advanced feedback and reflection UI components (e.g., post-milestone surveys, decision logs)
- Update recommendation and prioritization logic to leverage learning and cohort data
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for learning, cohort, and feedback features

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/services/learning/`, `cohort/`, `components/feedback/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend learning, feedback, and recommendation systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing analytics and reporting infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

---

## References to Extend/Modify

- `src/business-ops-hub/services/learning.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/cohort.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/feedback/FeedbackReflectionPanel.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/recommendation.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/ExecutiveDashboardPanel.tsx`

---

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new learning or feedback components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the cohort or pattern logic; build on the new learning system.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for learning, cohort, and feedback features
- Add integration tests for pattern recognition and reflection mechanisms
- Manual QA: Verify learning, cohort-based recommendations, and feedback/reflection flows
