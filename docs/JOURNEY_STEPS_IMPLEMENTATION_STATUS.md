# Journey Steps Implementation Status

## Sprint 1 Completed Deliverables (May 1 - May 5, 2025)

We've successfully completed the initial phase of the Journey UX Improvement project, which focused on setting up the database foundation and creating the data mapping layer between steps and the enhanced UI.

### 1. Database Views & Functions
- ✅ Created `journey_steps_enhanced` view that adds UI-focused properties to steps
- ✅ Created `company_step_progress` view for better progress tracking
- ✅ Implemented `get_enhanced_step` function to fetch steps with tool associations
- ✅ Implemented `get_personalized_step_tools` function for personalized recommendations

These database objects serve as the foundation for our approach, allowing us to use the original steps data structure while taking advantage of the improved UI design.

### 2. Type Definitions
- ✅ Created comprehensive types in `journey-steps.types.ts`
- ✅ Added interfaces for enhanced steps, progress tracking, and tool references
- ✅ Implemented helper functions for step-challenge mapping
- ✅ Added filtering interfaces for better data retrieval

The type system provides a complete bridge between the steps data model and the UI components, ensuring type safety throughout the application.

### 3. Service Layer
- ✅ Implemented `journeySteps.service.ts` with full CRUD operations
- ✅ Added methods for progress tracking and calculations
- ✅ Created personalized recommendation functions
- ✅ Added backward compatibility methods for challenge-based code

This service layer abstracts the database access and provides a clean API for components to interact with steps data.

### 4. Testing
- ✅ Created comprehensive test script in `test-journey-steps-service.js`
- ✅ Tests verify database views and functions
- ✅ Tests validate service methods with real data
- ✅ Tests ensure compatibility with existing tool system

## What's Coming Next

### Sprint 2: Component Rebrand & Service Completion (May 6 - May 12, 2025)

1. **Core Component Renaming**
   - Rename `ChallengeCard` → `StepCard`
   - Rename `ChallengeList` → `StepList` 
   - Update StatusBadge, DifficultyIndicator, EstimatedTime components
   - Update component references and exports

2. **Page Component Updates**
   - Rename page components (`JourneyChallengesPage` → `JourneyStepsPage`)
   - Update JourneyOverviewPage to use step terminology
   - Update references in imports and exports

3. **Tool Integration Services**
   - Update tool selection service to work with steps
   - Modify personalized recommendation functions
   - Update tool comparison functionality
   - Test tool association with steps data

4. **Service Layer Completion**
   - Complete remaining service methods
   - Create comprehensive test coverage
   - Document API changes

## Getting Started with the New Implementation

To use the new step-based Journey system:

1. Run the database migration:
   ```bash
   cd supabase
   npx supabase db push migrations/20250501000000_create_step_enhanced_views.sql
   ```

2. Test the implementation:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-journey-steps-service.js
   ```

3. Import the new service in components:
   ```typescript
   import journeyStepsService from "../lib/services/journeySteps.service";
   
   // Example usage
   const steps = await journeyStepsService.getEnhancedSteps();
   ```

## Backward Compatibility

If your code uses the old challenge-based model, you can use the backward compatibility methods:

```typescript
// Instead of:
import journeyChallengesService from "../lib/services/journeyChallenges.service";
const challenge = await journeyChallengesService.getChallengeById(id);

// Use:
import journeyStepsService from "../lib/services/journeySteps.service";
const challenge = await journeyStepsService.getChallengeById(id);
```

The returned data structure is compatible with existing challenge-based components, ensuring a smooth transition.
