### Database Changes

```sql
-- Feedback table
CREATE TABLE feedback (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  company_id UUID REFERENCES companies,
  entity_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'step', 'tool', 'resource', etc.
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL,
  rating INTEGER CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
  comment TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Improvement suggestions table
CREATE TABLE improvement_suggestions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  company_id UUID REFERENCES companies,
  entity_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'step', 'tool', 'resource', etc.
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL,
  category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  impact_description TEXT,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
  votes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Votes on suggestions
CREATE TABLE suggestion_votes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  suggestion_id UUID REFERENCES improvement_suggestions NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  vote_type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, -- 'up' or 'down'
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(suggestion_id, user_id)
);
```

## Advanced Journey Visualization

### Components to Implement

#### 1. InteractiveJourneyMap
- **Purpose**: Provide a visually rich, interactive map of the company's journey
- **Features**:
  - Zoomable/pannable interface
  - Path visualization
  - Multi-level detail
  - Color coding for status and categories
  - Connection lines showing dependencies
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - SVG or Canvas-based rendering
  - React state management for interactions
  - Responsive layout

#### 2. MilestoneCelebrationAnimations
- **Purpose**: Celebrate user accomplishments with visual feedback
- **Features**:
  - Confetti animations for completed milestones
  - Achievement badges
  - Notification system for team celebrations
  - Progress milestones with custom animations
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Animation libraries (framer-motion, lottie)
  - Achievement tracking system
  - Notification integration

#### 3. AdvancedProgressIndicators
- **Purpose**: Provide more detailed and contextual progress information
- **Features**:
  - Multi-dimensional progress bars
  - Predictive completion estimates
  - Comparative progress (vs. industry)
  - Micro-progress tracking within steps
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Custom progress visualization components
  - Data aggregation for comparisons
  - Time estimation algorithms

### UI/UX Considerations

1. **Accessibility**
   - All animations must be optional
   - Color schemes must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements

2. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading for animation assets
   - Component virtualization for large journey maps
   - Debounced event handlers for interactions

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Adaptable layouts for small screens
   - Touch-friendly interactions
   - Reduced animation complexity on low-power devices

## Integration with Previous Sprint Work

- The feedback system will integrate with the StepAssistant to improve AI recommendations
- User ratings will influence recommendation scoring in the recommendation engine
- Celebration animations will trigger based on analytics events tracked in Sprint 3
- Progress indicators will use data from the JourneyAnalyticsDashboard
- The InteractiveJourneyMap will build on the StepRelationshipMap visualization

## Metrics for Success

1. **User Engagement**
   - Increase in time spent on journey pages
   - Higher interaction rate with steps and tools
   - Reduced bounce rate from journey pages

2. **Feedback Collection**
   - Number of ratings submitted
   - Quality of improvement suggestions
   - Actionable insights generated from feedback

3. **Visualization Effectiveness**
   - Task completion rate improvement
   - Reduction in "lost" user sessions
   - Positive feedback on visualization clarity

## Technical Considerations

- Use virtualization for rendering large collections (suggestions, feedback items)
- Implement proper client-side caching to reduce API calls
- Ensure animations are performant across device types
- Add appropriate error boundaries around new components
- Implement analytics tracking for all user interactions

## Next Steps After Sprint 4

- Machine learning-based recommendations using collected feedback
- A/B testing of different visualization approaches
- Social features (team collaboration, sharing achievements)
- Integration with external productivity tools
