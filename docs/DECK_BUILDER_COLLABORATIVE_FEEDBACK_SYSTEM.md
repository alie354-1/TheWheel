# AI-Powered Collaborative Deck Feedback System

## 1. Vision
To create the most intuitive and intelligent pitch deck collaboration platform. Users will be able to share decks seamlessly, receive contextual feedback from stakeholders, and leverage AI to automatically analyze, prioritize, and incorporate that feedback, leading to significantly improved deck quality and faster iteration cycles. The system will also learn from all interactions to continuously enhance templates, components, and AI suggestions.

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1. Enhanced Sharing System
Building upon the existing Phase 2 sharing infrastructure, this system introduces more granular control and richer interaction models.

**Smart Sharing Links & Modes:**
-   **`ReviewMode`**: Stakeholders can view and add comments/suggestions. Ideal for general feedback.
-   **`CollaborateMode`**: Enables real-time feedback collection, potentially with live cursors and presence indicators.
-   **`FeedbackMode`**: Presents structured input forms alongside each slide, guiding reviewers to provide specific types of feedback (e.g., clarity, impact, data accuracy).
-   **Role-Based Permissions**:
    -   `Owner`: Full control.
    -   `Editor` (Future): Can edit content directly.
    -   `Reviewer`: Can comment and make suggestions.
    -   `Advisor`: Comments carry more weight.
    -   `Investor`: Comments might trigger specific AI analysis for financial viability, market fit, etc.
    -   `Viewer`: Read-only access.

### 2.2. Weighted Feedback Collection
Prioritizing feedback based on reviewer credibility and expertise.

**Reviewer Profiles:**
```typescript
interface ReviewerProfile {
  userId: string; // Links to existing user accounts or guest identifier
  deckId: string;
  displayName: string;
  email?: string; // Optional for guests
  role: 'Owner' | 'Editor' | 'Reviewer' | 'Advisor' | 'Investor' | 'Viewer';
  weight: number; // Default 1.0, adjustable by Owner (e.g., 0.1 to 2.0)
  expertiseTags: string[]; // e.g., ["finance", "marketing", "deep-tech", "GTM"]
  // Future: credibilityScore: number; // Historical accuracy/usefulness of feedback
}
```

**Smart Feedback Types & Input:**
-   **Slide-Level Comments**: General remarks about a slide.
-   **Element-Specific Comments**: Tied to a particular text block, image, chart, or even a selected area.
-   **Content Suggestions**: Reviewers can propose alternative text or data.
-   **Structural Feedback**: Suggestions to reorder, add, or remove slides.
-   **Visual Feedback**: Comments on design, layout, colors, fonts.
-   **Urgency Ratings**: Reviewers can mark feedback as `Critical`, `Important`, or `Suggestion`.
-   **Quick Reactions**: üëç, üëé, ü§î, üí°, ‚ù§Ô∏è, ‚ùì on slides or specific elements.
-   **Voice Notes**: Audio comments, auto-transcribed and linked to slide/element.
-   **Markup Tools**: Simple drawing/highlighting on the slide canvas.

### 2.3. Ultra-Intuitive Commenting System ("Click Anywhere")
Designed for zero-friction feedback.

**"Click Anywhere" Interaction:**
1.  **Hover**: Elements (text, images, charts, defined content blocks, even whitespace regions) subtly highlight.
2.  **Click**: An instant comment bubble/input field appears at the click location.
3.  **Input Methods**:
    *   Text input with rich text options (bold, italic, lists).
    *   Voice-to-text for quick dictation.
    *   Predefined quick reactions.
4.  **Contextual Anchoring**: Comments are visually anchored to the clicked element or coordinate.
    *   If an element is moved/resized, comments try to follow intelligently.
    *   Comments on deleted elements are archived but accessible.

**Advanced Commenting UX:**
-   **Comment Threads**: Replies and discussions within each comment.
-   **Resolve Comments**: Owners can mark comments as addressed.
-   **Assign Comments**: (Future) Assign feedback items as tasks.
-   **Filter/Sort Comments**: By reviewer, slide, status (open/resolved), urgency.
-   **Notification System**: Real-time or summary notifications for new feedback.

```typescript
// Represents a comment instance
interface DeckComment {
  id: string;
  deckId: string;
  slideId: string;
  elementId?: string; // If anchored to a specific visual component
  coordinates?: { x: number, y: number }; // If anchored to a point on the slide
  authorUserId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  text: string;
  richTextContent?: string; // For formatted comments
  voiceNoteUrl?: string;
  transcription?: string;
  markupData?: any; // For drawings/highlights
  commentType: 'General' | 'Suggestion' | 'Question' | 'Praise' | 'Concern'; // Can be AI-assisted
  urgency: 'Critical' | 'Important' | 'Suggestion' | 'None';
  replies: DeckComment[];
  status: 'Open' | 'Resolved' | 'InProgress';
  reactions: { userId: string, reactionType: string }[];
}
```

### 2.4. AI Feedback Analysis Engine
Transforms raw feedback into actionable insights.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Understanding:**
-   **Intent Recognition**: Identify if a comment is a question, suggestion, criticism, etc.
-   **Sentiment Analysis**: Positive, negative, neutral tone.
-   **Topic Modeling**: Group comments by common themes (e.g., "market size", "team slide").
-   **Action Item Extraction**: Identify concrete tasks from feedback.
-   **Conflict Detection**: Highlight contradictory feedback from different reviewers.
-   **Summarization**: Provide executive summaries of feedback for busy owners.

**AI-Powered Content Generation & Suggestion:**
-   **Rewrite Suggestions**: Offer alternative phrasing for clarity, conciseness, or impact based on feedback.
-   **Data Augmentation**: Suggest adding specific data points, statistics, or sources if feedback indicates a lack.
-   **Structural Recommendations**: Propose reordering slides or adding new ones (e.g., "Consider adding a slide on competitive advantages after the Problem slide").
-   **Visual Enhancements**: Suggest alternative chart types, color palettes, or image styles based on feedback like "this chart is hard to read."

### 2.5. Automatic Update System (with Owner Approval)
Streamlines the incorporation of feedback.

**AI-Generated Update Proposals:**
-   For each piece of actionable feedback (or cluster of related feedback), the AI generates a proposed change.
```typescript
interface UpdateProposal {
  id: string;
  deckId: string;
  slideId: string;
  elementId?: string; // Target element for the change
  changeType: 'TextEdit' | 'ImageSwap' | 'ChartUpdate' | 'NewElement' | 'ReorderElement' | 'DeleteElement' | 'NewSlide' | 'ReorderSlide';
  originalContent?: any; // Snapshot of content before change
  proposedContent: any; // The AI's suggested new content/data
  description: string; // AI's explanation of the change and why
  sourceFeedbackIds: string[]; // Links to comments that prompted this proposal
  confidenceScore: number; // AI's confidence in the proposal (0-1)
  weightedFeedbackScore: number; // Aggregate score from reviewers' weights
  status: 'Pending' | 'Accepted' | 'Rejected' | 'Modified';
}
```
-   **Owner Approval Workflow**:
    -   A dedicated "Feedback Inbox" or "Suggested Changes" panel.
    -   Proposals are displayed with context (original content, proposed change, source feedback).
    -   Options: `Accept`, `Reject`, `Edit & Accept`.
    -   Batch operations for multiple proposals.
    -   Visual diffing for text changes.
    -   Change history and easy rollback for accepted proposals.

### 2.6. Comprehensive Content Intelligence System
The system learns from every interaction to improve itself and provide better guidance.

**Data Logging for Learning:**
-   **Content Snapshots**: Versions of slides and components at different stages.
-   **Feedback Data**: All comments, suggestions, reactions, and their metadata.
-   **User Actions**: How owners interact with feedback and AI proposals (accept, reject, edit).
-   **Deck Performance**: (If analytics are integrated) How decks perform after changes.
-   **Template & Component Usage**: Which templates/components are popular, effective, or often criticized.

**AI-Powered Template & Component Evolution:**
-   **Pattern Recognition**:
    -   Identify common feedback points for specific slide types or components.
    -   Discover content patterns in high-performing decks.
    -   Detect gaps in existing templates or component libraries.
-   **Automatic Improvement Suggestions**:
    -   For Template Maintainers: "The 'Market Size' slide in 'SaaS Pitch Template' frequently receives feedback about lacking source citations. Consider adding a placeholder for sources."
    -   For Component Library: "The 'Basic Bar Chart' component is often criticized for color contrast. Suggest updating default theme."
-   **New Template/Component Generation (Future)**:
    -   Based on successful custom decks, AI could propose new, optimized templates.
    -   Identify needs for new component types based on common custom HTML or complex image usage.

**Modifications to Existing Tables:**
*   `pitch_decks`:
    *   Add `last_feedback_activity_at TIMESTAMPTZ`
    *   Add `feedback_summary JSONB` (AI-generated high-level summary)

### 7.4. AI Service Integration
*   Abstract AI interactions behind a service layer (`AIService.ts`).
*   Initial integration with a chosen LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic Claude) via their SDK/API.
*   Functions for:
    *   `analyzeFeedback(comments: DeckComment[]): Promise<FeedbackAnalysis>`
    *   `generateContentSuggestion(context: string, feedback: string): Promise<ContentSuggestion>`
    *   `summarizeFeedback(comments: DeckComment[]): Promise<string>`
    *   `transcribeAudio(audioUrl: string): Promise<string>`

This detailed plan should provide a solid foundation for building this exciting new collaborative feedback system.
