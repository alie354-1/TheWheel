# THE WHEEL MIGRATION STRATEGY

## From Wheel99 to The Wheel: Evolution Approach

This document outlines the strategy for evolving the current Wheel99 platform into The Wheel, a comprehensive founder operating system. The approach emphasizes maintaining system stability while progressively enhancing capabilities.

## Migration Principles

### 1. Extend Rather Than Replace
* Build upon successful components like the Idea Playground and Standup Bot
* Maintain backward compatibility with existing features
* Preserve user data and user workflows
* Avoid disrupting active users' experiences

### 2. Modular Enhancement Strategy
* Identify and prioritize gap areas based on user impact
* Implement enhancements as modular, interoperable components
* Integrate new capabilities with existing systems through well-defined interfaces
* Use feature flags to control rollout of new capabilities

### 3. Progressive Rollout
* Phase implementation to maintain platform stability
* Introduce capabilities incrementally with controlled access
* Gather feedback and iterate rapidly
* Use beta program for early adopter feedback

### 4. Leverage Technical Foundation
* Build on existing modular architecture
* Extend AI systems with new capabilities
* Enhance database schema while maintaining compatibility
* Utilize existing components where possible

## Existing Foundation Assessment

The Wheel99 platform provides several strong foundations that can be extended:

### Core Systems to Leverage

1. **Identity and Profile System**
   * Currently implements role-based approach
   * Has multi-persona database schema (disabled in UI)
   * Already collects role-specific profile information
   * **Evolution Path**: Reactivate and enhance the multi-persona functionality to support the Mode system

2. **AI Integration Framework**
   * Three-tiered contextual model (general, domain, user)
   * Modular AI service interfaces
   * Multiple provider support (OpenAI, Hugging Face)
   * **Evolution Path**: Extend AI capabilities to cover all seven pillars

3. **Idea Development Workflow**
   * Pathway-based progression system
   * Step indicators and navigation
   * Stage-based content organization
   * **Evolution Path**: Generalize this approach for the Progress Tracker

4. **Unified Workspaces**
   * UnifiedIdeaWorkspace pattern
   * Component-based UI organization
   * Context providers for data management
   * **Evolution Path**: Apply pattern to other pillar workspaces

5. **Supabase Data Layer**
   * Row-level security implementation
   * Migrations management
   * Service abstraction for data access
   * **Evolution Path**: Extend schema for new pillars while maintaining security model
