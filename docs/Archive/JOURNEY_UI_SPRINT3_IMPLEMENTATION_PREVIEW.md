# Journey UI Sprint 3 - Implementation Preview

This document provides a visual preview and implementation guide for the new components added in Sprint 3 of the Journey UI enhancements.

## Analytics Dashboard Overview

The new JourneyAnalyticsDashboard component provides an interactive, data-rich visualization of a company's journey progress. It includes:

- Interactive tabs for Overview, Phase Progress, and Industry Comparison
- Time range filters (Week, Month, Quarter, Year, All)
- Responsive charts for progress visualization
- Comparative analytics with similar companies

### How to Access the Analytics Dashboard

The dashboard is accessible through the "Timeline" view in the JourneyMapPage:

1. Navigate to the Company Journey page
2. Click on the "Timeline" view option in the FilterBar
3. The dashboard will display with the default "month" timeframe

## Component Structure

```
src/
└── components/
    └── company/
        └── journey/
            ├── Analytics/
            │   ├── index.ts
            │   └── JourneyAnalyticsDashboard.tsx
            ├── StepRecommendations/
            │   ├── NextBestSteps.tsx
            │   ├── StepRelationshipMap.tsx
            │   └── index.ts
            └── ...
```

## Sample Usage

```tsx
// In any component
import { JourneyAnalyticsDashboard } from '@/components/company/journey/Analytics';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h2>Journey Analytics</h2>
      <JourneyAnalyticsDashboard 
        timeRange="month" 
        className="my-6"
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## UI Preview

When implemented, the dashboard will display as follows:

### Overview Tab
![Overview Tab]()
- Key metrics summary (completion rate, steps completed, avg. completion time)
- Timeline chart showing progress over selected time period
- Interactive cards with hover states

### Phase Progress Tab
![Phase Progress Tab]()
- Bar charts showing completion status by phase
- Time estimation accuracy comparison 
- Interactive tooltips with detailed information

### Industry Comparison Tab
![Industry Comparison Tab]()
- Pie chart comparing company progress against industry benchmarks
- Progress bars visualizing relative standing
- Table of popular industry steps with adoption rates

## Analytics Integration

The dashboard utilizes the RecommendationService to fetch journey analytics data:

```tsx
// In the JourneyAnalyticsDashboard component
const fetchAnalytics = async () => {
  if (!currentCompany?.id) return;
  
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    const data = await RecommendationService.getJourneyAnalytics(currentCompany.id);
    setAnalytics(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading journey analytics:', error);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

## User Experiences

### Filter Interaction
Users can filter the analytics view by time range:
- Week: Shows detailed progress in the last 7 days
- Month: Shows progress over the current calendar month (default)
- Quarter: Shows progress over the last 3 months
- Year: Shows annual progress view
- All: Shows all-time progress with no time filtering

### Mobile Responsiveness
The dashboard is fully responsive:
- On mobile devices, cards stack vertically
- Charts resize to fit screen width
- Tab navigation remains accessible at all screen sizes

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the StepAssistant component** - This will provide AI-powered contextual help based on the current step
2. **Add user feedback collection** - Implement the InlineRatingComponent for gathering user feedback
3. **Enhance visual effects** - Add celebration animations for milestone achievements

## Dependencies

- chart.js: Used for rendering data visualizations
- react-chartjs-2: React wrapper for Chart.js
- framer-motion: Used for animations and transitions

## Installation

The required dependencies have been added to the project:
