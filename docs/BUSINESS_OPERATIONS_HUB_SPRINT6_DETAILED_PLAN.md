# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 6 Detailed Plan

## Sprint Theme: Decision Intelligence System

Sprint 6 delivers a learning layer that tracks user decisions, collects feedback, explains recommendations, dynamically adjusts priorities, and leverages cohort-based pattern recognition.

## User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, Engineering Tasks, and Notes

---

### **Story 1: Decision Tracking Service**

**User Story:**  
As a product manager, when users interact with the system, I want to capture their decisions and actions in a structured format, so we can learn from usage patterns and improve recommendations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All key user actions (task completion, tool adoption, feedback, etc.) are logged as events.
- Events are stored in a `decision_events` table with standardized metadata.
- Events can be retrieved via an API for analytics and personalization.

**Engineering Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `decision_events` table in the database.
- [ ] Implement backend event logging for all major user actions.
- [ ] Expose API endpoint for logging and retrieving decision events.
- [ ] Integrate event logging into frontend flows (recommendations, tool usage, task completion).

**Notes:**
- Ensure privacy and performance in event logging.
- Use event types and context for flexible analytics.

### **Story 2: Feedback Collection Interface**

**User Story:**  
As a founder, when I receive recommendations or use tools, I want to provide quick feedback on their relevance and usefulness, so I can influence future suggestions and improve my experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can provide micro-feedback (thumbs up/down, star ratings, quick surveys) on recommendations, tools, and guides.
- Feedback is stored in a `recommendation_feedback` table.
- Feedback can be submitted and retrieved via API.
- Feedback prompts appear at key moments (after using a tool, completing a guide, etc.).

**Engineering Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `recommendation_feedback` table in the database.
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for submitting and retrieving feedback.
- [ ] Add feedback UI to recommendations, tool actions, and guides.
- [ ] Integrate feedback submission into frontend.

**Notes:**
- Limit feedback requests to avoid fatigue.
- Allow both quick and detailed feedback.

### **Story 3: Recommendation Explanation Component**

**User Story:**  
As a founder, when I receive a recommendation, I want to understand why it was suggested to me, so I can evaluate its relevance and build trust in the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each recommendation/tool displays an explanation (reasoning, confidence score, key factors).
- Explanations are concise, with expandable details.
- Users can provide feedback on explanations.

**Engineering Tasks:**
- [ ] Extend recommendation API to return explanation data.
- [ ] Add UI component to display explanations and confidence scores.
- [ ] Allow users to view details and provide feedback on explanations.

**Notes:**
- Use plain language and visual cues for explanations.
- Indicate when recommendations are cohort-derived.

---

### **Story 4: Dynamic Priority Adjustment**

**User Story:**  
As a founder, when my business situation changes, I want task priorities to update automatically, so I can focus on what's most important without manual reprioritization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Task and tool priorities update in real time based on new data (business events, feedback, cohort trends).
- Users can "lock" or override priorities for specific tasks.
- Priority changes are reflected in the UI and can be explained.

**Engineering Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement backend logic to recalculate priorities dynamically.
- [ ] Expose API endpoint to fetch and trigger updated priorities.
- [ ] Update frontend to reflect real-time priority changes.
- [ ] Add UI for locking/overriding priorities.

**Notes:**
- Use smoothing algorithms to prevent priority thrashing.
- Track and display priority history.

---

### **Story 5: Cohort-Based Pattern Recognition**

**User Story:**  
As a founder, when I use the system, I want to benefit from patterns observed across similar businesses, so I can learn from others' experiences while maintaining privacy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Companies are grouped into cohorts based on profile (industry, size, stage, etc.).
- Cohort analysis identifies successful patterns and recommendations.
- Cohort-derived insights are available via API and shown in the UI.
- Users are informed when a suggestion is based on cohort data.

**Engineering Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement backend logic for cohort formation and pattern mining.
- [ ] Create `cohort_patterns` table for storing insights.
- [ ] Expose API endpoint for cohort-based recommendations and insights.
- [ ] Display cohort-derived suggestions and indicators in the frontend.

**Notes:**
- Ensure strict privacy protections for cohort analysis.
- Allow opt-out from cohort-based personalization.

## Additional Engineering Notes

- All new APIs should be documented and tested.
- Ensure all new tables have appropriate indexes and retention policies.
- Integrate event and feedback logging with analytics dashboards.
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout of new intelligence features.
- Plan for A/B testing of cohort-based recommendations and explanations.
