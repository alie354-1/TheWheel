- JourneyChallengesPage implementation
- Enhanced JourneyStepPage (challenge detail view)

## Development Approach

We're following a component-first development approach:

1. Build and test individual UI components
2. Develop service layer functions
3. Implement page components that use these elements
4. Integrate with existing systems

This allows us to create a solid foundation of reusable components before assembling them into full pages.

## Current Focus

The team is currently focused on completing the remaining core UI components and preparing for the database migration that will convert existing journey steps to the new challenge-based format.

## Next Actions

1. Complete remaining Sprint 1 tasks
2. Finalize database migration script and test with sample data
3. Prepare for Sprint 2 planning (scheduled for May 12, 2025)
4. Review UI component designs with design team

## Blockers

None currently identified.
