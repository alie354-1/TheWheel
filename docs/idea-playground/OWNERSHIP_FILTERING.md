# Idea Ownership Filtering

This document describes the ownership filtering feature added to the Enhanced Idea Hub.

## Overview

The Enhanced Idea Hub now supports filtering ideas by ownership type, allowing users to easily distinguish between personal ideas and company ideas. This feature helps users manage their ideas more effectively, especially when they have a mix of personal projects and company initiatives.

## Implementation Details

### Types

The ownership filtering feature is built on the following type definitions:

- `OwnershipType`: An enum with values `'personal'` or `'company'`
- `IdeaFilters`: Updated to include an optional `ownershipType` property

### UI Components

The ownership filtering UI is implemented in the `EnhancedIdeaHub` component, which provides filter buttons for:

- All ideas (no ownership filter)
- Personal ideas only
- Company ideas only

The selected filter is visually indicated with a different background color.

### Filtering Logic

When a user selects an ownership filter:

1. The filter selection is stored in the component's state
2. The filter is applied to the ideas array using the `filter()` method
3. Only ideas matching the selected ownership type are displayed
4. The filter is also stored in the global store for persistence

### Store Integration

The ownership filter is integrated with the Zustand store:

- The filter value is stored in the `filters` object in the store
- The `setFilters` action is used to update the filter
- The filter persists across component re-renders

## Usage

Users can filter ideas by ownership type by clicking on the corresponding filter buttons in the Enhanced Idea Hub:

- "All" button: Shows all ideas regardless of ownership
- "Personal" button: Shows only ideas with `ownershipType === 'personal'`
- "Company" button: Shows only ideas with `ownershipType === 'company'`

## Testing

A test script (`scripts/test-idea-ownership-filter.js`) is provided to verify the ownership filtering functionality. The script:

1. Creates test ideas with different ownership types
2. Tests filtering by personal ownership
3. Tests filtering by company ownership
4. Cleans up the test data

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the ownership filtering feature:

- Add filter presets that include ownership type
- Add sorting by ownership type
- Add bulk actions for ideas of a specific ownership type
- Add ownership transfer functionality (personal to company and vice versa)
