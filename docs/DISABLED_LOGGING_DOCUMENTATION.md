# Disabled Logging Services Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to disable logging services that were causing errors in the application. The goal was to maintain database functionality for most features while preventing errors related to logging, consent settings, and model training.

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled Logging Service

The `logging.service.ts` has been modified to be a no-op service that:
- Maintains the same interface as the original service
- Logs to console instead of the database
- Returns mock data where needed
- Handles all method signatures required by the hooks

### 2. Disabled Privacy Service

The `privacy.service.ts` has been modified to be a no-op service that:
- Returns default consent settings
- Prevents 406 errors from consent_settings endpoints
- Logs operations to console only

### 3. Disabled Model Training Service

The `model-training.service.ts` has been modified to be a no-op service that:
- Prevents database errors from feature extraction
- Returns mock data for model evaluation
- Logs operations to console only

### 4. Enhanced Feature Flags Service

The `feature-flags.service.ts` has been modified to:
- Read from the database but not write to it
- Maintain in-memory state for feature flags
- Provide default values when database access fails

### 5. Enhanced Error Boundaries

The `ErrorBoundary.tsx` component has been enhanced with:
- More detailed error logging
- Performance tracking for recovery attempts
- Better error context information

### 6. Enhanced Dashboard Component

The `Dashboard.tsx` component has been enhanced with:
- More detailed console logging
- Better error handling for component loading
- Performance tracking for data loading operations
- Parallel data loading with Promise.allSettled

## How to Use

The application should now function normally with most database features working, but without logging to the database. The console will show detailed information about operations that would normally write to the database.

### Expected Console Output

You will see console messages like:
- `[LoggingService] Event (DISABLED): event_name`
- `[PrivacyService] getUserConsent called (DISABLED) for user: user_id`
- `[ModelTrainingService] No logs found for feature extraction`

### Testing

A test script has been created at `scripts/test-dashboard-load.js` to verify the changes, but it may require additional configuration to run properly in the project's environment.

## Reverting These Changes

To revert to full database logging in the future:
1. Restore the original implementations of the services
2. Ensure the database tables for logging, consent settings, and model training exist
3. Update the error handling in the Dashboard component if needed

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors in the console:
1. Check if they are related to other services not covered by these changes
2. Verify that the browser is using the latest code (hard refresh may be needed)
3. Check the network tab for any remaining API calls that might be failing
