# Hugging Face Spaces Integration Removal

This document outlines the steps taken to remove the Hugging Face Spaces integration from the application, while preserving the standard Hugging Face API functionality.

## Background

The Hugging Face Spaces integration was initially added to provide an alternative way to access LLM capabilities through Hugging Face's Spaces feature. After evaluation, we've decided to standardize on the direct Hugging Face API integration instead, which offers better reliability and performance.

## Changes Made

1. **UI Components Removed**
   - `HuggingFaceSpacesSettings.tsx` component removed from admin panel
   - References to Spaces removed from FeatureFlagsSettings (keeping standard HuggingFace API option)

2. **Service Layer Updates**
   - Removed `huggingface-spaces-client.ts` 
   - Removed `huggingface-spaces-llm.service.ts`
   - Updated `feature-flags.service.ts` to no longer check for Spaces-specific flags
   - Modified `general-llm.service.ts` to remove Spaces integration path

3. **Database Changes**
   - The `huggingface_spaces` entry in the `app_settings` table can remain for record-keeping
   - The `useHuggingFaceSpaces` feature flag in the feature flags table is no longer referenced in code

4. **Scripts and Migrations**
   - Archived scripts related to Hugging Face Spaces setup and configuration
   - Created `archive-huggingface-spaces.cjs` to safely archive related files

5. **Documentation**
   - Moved Spaces-specific documentation to the archive

## Files Moved to Archive

Files related to Hugging Face Spaces have been moved to the `archive/huggingface-spaces` directory, preserving their structure for potential future reference. This includes:

- Source code files (`src/lib/huggingface-spaces-client.ts`, `src/lib/services/huggingface-spaces-llm.service.ts`, etc.)
- Scripts for Spaces setup and configuration
- Documentation specific to Spaces integration

## Impact on Standard Hugging Face API Integration

The standard Hugging Face API integration through `huggingface-llm.service.ts` and `huggingface-client.ts` remains fully functional. Users can still enable the Hugging Face API as an alternative to OpenAI through the feature flags.

## How to Run the Archive Script

To remove and archive all Hugging Face Spaces related files:

```bash
node scripts/archive-huggingface-spaces.cjs
```

## Future Considerations

If reimplementing Hugging Face Spaces integration in the future, refer to the archived files for implementation details. The migration script (`scripts/run-huggingface-spaces-migration.js`) can also be used as a reference for setting up the necessary database entries.
