# Journey System Sprint 5: Advanced Analytics & AI-Powered Optimization — Detailed Plan

## User Stories, Engineering Tasks, and Acceptance Criteria

---

### BOH-501: Advanced Analytics Dashboard

**User Story:**  
As a manager, I want to view predictive insights, multi-dimensional reports, and exportable analytics so I can make data-driven decisions.

**Engineering Tasks:**
1. Implement analytics data warehouse schema (analytics_events, analytics_aggregates, analytics_reports, analytics_dashboards)
2. Develop core dashboard components (PredictiveInsightsPanel, MultiDimensionalReporting, VisualizationToolkit)
3. Integrate predictive analytics (completion forecasting, bottleneck prediction, tool adoption projections, team velocity)
4. Build custom report builder and export (CSV, Excel, PDF)
5. Implement scheduled and comparative reports

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard loads key metrics in under 3 seconds
- Users can generate, export, and schedule custom reports
- Predictive insights (completion, bottlenecks, adoption) are visible and actionable
- Comparative analysis across teams is supported

### BOH-502: AI-Powered Journey Optimization

**User Story:**  
As a user, I want the system to recommend optimal paths, tools, and resource allocations to maximize journey success.

**Engineering Tasks:**
1. Build Smart Journey Recommendations (optimal path, tool stacking, effort-impact, resource allocation, timeline optimization)
2. Develop Content Improvement Engine (quality assessment, gap identification, clarity, difficulty balancing, personalized adaptation)
3. Integrate with analytics and feedback data for continuous optimization

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AI recommendations achieve at least 80% user acceptance rate
- Content improvement suggestions are available for all major journey steps
- Resource and timeline optimization is visible in the dashboard

### BOH-503: Personalized Learning Paths

**User Story:**  
As a learner, I want my journey to adapt to my learning style, engagement, and skill gaps for a more effective experience.

**Engineering Tasks:**
1. Implement user behavior analysis (learning style, progress patterns, engagement, skill gap, preference modeling)
2. Build dynamic path adjustment (adaptive difficulty, interest-based content, skill-gap targeting, time-optimized sequences)
3. Enable team synchronization features for collaborative learning

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Personalized paths show 25% better engagement than generic paths (measured via engagement_metrics)
- Users can see and adjust their learning preferences
- Adaptive content and difficulty are reflected in the journey UI

### BOH-504: External Training Integration

**User Story:**  
As an enterprise user, I want to sync with external LMS and content providers for unified training and credential management.

**Engineering Tasks:**
1. Integrate with LMS (content sync, progress tracking, credential management, assessment, SSO)
2. Connect to third-party content providers (API ingestion, resource linking, content rating, usage tracking, cost optimization)
3. Build integration management UI and credential storage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- LMS and content provider integrations maintain 99.9% uptime
- Users can access external content and see unified progress
- Credentials and assessments are synchronized and visible in the platform

### BOH-505: Enterprise Customization

**User Story:**  
As an admin, I want to configure access, branding, and compliance features to match my organization’s needs.

**Engineering Tasks:**
1. Implement multi-level administration (role-based access, department config, approval workflows, audit logging, compliance reporting)
2. Build white-labeling and branding (theme, terminology, custom domain, email/PDF branding)
3. Develop admin UI for all customization features

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Enterprise customization requires no code changes for typical configurations
- Audit logs and compliance reports are exportable
- Branding is reflected across all user-facing components

### BOH-506: Performance Optimization

**User Story:**  
As a user, I want the platform to remain fast and responsive, even with large data and real-time features.

**Engineering Tasks:**
1. Optimize database queries, caching, and asset delivery
2. Scale backend services and improve API response times
3. Tune WebSocket and real-time analytics performance
4. Ensure mobile and collaborative features are responsive

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Analytics dashboard loads in under 3 seconds
- System maintains sub-500ms response times under full load
- Real-time features are responsive and reliable
