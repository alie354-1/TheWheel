# Idea Playground AI Features Fix

## Issue Identified

The AI features in the Idea Playground stopped working due to a change in the feature flags configuration in `src/lib/store.ts`. Specifically:

- The `useRealAI` flag was set to `false` (previously `true`)
- This prevented the AI generation services from properly functioning

## Fix Applied

We've made the following changes to restore AI functionality:

1. Updated the default value of `useRealAI` to `true` in `src/lib/store.ts`
2. Kept `useMockAI` enabled as a fallback option
3. Created helper scripts to reset the LLM services

## How the Fix Works

The `sequential-generation.service.ts` is designed to only return genuine AI-generated suggestions without mock data. When `useRealAI` is disabled, it skips real AI generation but also doesn't generate any mock suggestions by design, resulting in no data being displayed.

By enabling `useRealAI` again, the generation service properly attempts to create AI-generated ideas, restoring the expected functionality.

## How to Use

If you experience issues with AI generation after a refresh or app restart, you can:

1. Run the simple fix script to apply the feature flag changes in memory:
   ```
   node scripts/fix-ai-feature-flags.js
   ```

2. Alternatively, you can check and modify the feature flags directly in the Settings UI:
   - Go to "Admin" â†’ "Feature Flags"
   - Ensure "Use Real AI" is enabled

## Long-Term Solution

The permanent fix has been applied to the default values in the store, so this setting will persist across application restarts. The behavior has been tested and verified to work consistently.

The modular architecture still supports toggling between real AI and mock mode, but defaults to using real AI for better user experience.
