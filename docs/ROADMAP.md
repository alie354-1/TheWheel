## Introduction

This roadmap outlines the planned improvements and future direction for Wheel99. It is organized into short-term enhancements that are actively in development, long-term vision items that represent the strategic direction, and technical debt items that need to be addressed for maintainability and performance.

The roadmap is a living document and will be updated as priorities shift, new opportunities emerge, and as we gather user feedback. Items are not strictly prioritized within each section, and timelines are intentionally not provided to allow for flexibility in implementation.
