# Journey Dashboard Redesign: Executive Summary

## Overview

This document provides an executive summary of the Journey Dashboard redesign project, which consists of two main components:

1. **UI Redesign**: Aligning the dashboard layouts with approved wireframes (Options 3 & 4)
2. **AI Integration**: Replacing hardcoded content with dynamic, personalized AI-generated insights

The redesign aims to improve user experience for founders by providing a more intuitive interface and delivering personalized, context-aware guidance.

## Key Components

### 1. UI Redesign

We're implementing two dashboard layouts that match the approved wireframes:

**Option 3: Side-by-Side Panels Layout**
- Left sidebar with steps categorized by status
- Main content with two side-by-side panels:
  - "Pick Up Where You Left Off" (active steps)
  - "Recommended Next Steps" (AI-driven recommendations)
- Right sidebar with Business Health summary

**Option 4: Clean Tabbed Layout**
- More compact left sidebar
- Full-width main content with three tabs:
  - "Current Work" (active steps + domain progress + peer insights)
  - "Recommended Next Steps" (recommendation cards)
  - "Business Health" (detailed domain analysis)

Both layouts feature expandable/collapsible sections for detailed information, consistent styling, and optimized information hierarchy.

### 2. AI-Driven Content

Replacing static hardcoded content with dynamic AI-generated guidance:

**Three Content Types:**
1. **Step Recommendations**: Suggesting personalized next steps based on company progress
2. **Peer Insights**: Generating authentic-sounding founder perspectives and advice
3. **Business Health Analysis**: Assessing domain maturity and suggesting focus areas

**AI System Components:**
1. **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully crafted prompts that generate high-quality, relevant content
2. **Context Collection**: Gathering company data, progress, and peer patterns
3. **Persistence Layer**: Caching and managing AI-generated content lifecycle
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Ensuring reliable content delivery even when AI generation fails

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Documentation & Planning (Current Phase)
- Detailed implementation plan for UI components
- AI prompting system documentation
- Database schema for content persistence
- Executive summary (this document)

### Phase 2: UI Implementation
- Create standardized components
- Implement Option 3 layout
- Implement Option 4 layout
- Update navigation

### Phase 3: AI Service Implementation
- Database schema creation
- Service interfaces implementation
- Context collection pipeline
- OpenAI integration

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- Connect UI to AI services
- Implement loading and error states
- Test with different company profiles
- Refine and optimize

## Technical Architecture

### UI Components

**Key Components:**
- `NewJourneyStepsSidebar`: Left sidebar with steps and progress
- `ExpandableStepCard`: Expandable active step cards
- `ExpandableRecommendationCard`: Expandable recommendation cards
- `BusinessHealthSidebar`: Right sidebar for Option 3
- `DomainProgressCard`: Full domain details for Option 4

### AI Services

**Core Services:**
- `aiDashboardService`: Generates recommendations, insights, and health analysis
- `aiPersistenceService`: Manages caching and content lifecycle
- `openAiService`: Handles OpenAI API interactions
- `contextCollectorService`: Gathers relevant company context

**Database Structure:**
- `ai_generated_recommendations`: Stores step recommendations

   - More successful outcomes through focused recommendations

## Next Steps

1. Request stakeholder approval of design and implementation plan
2. Begin Phase 2 (UI Implementation)
3. Set up database schema for AI persistence
4. Create mock AI services for initial testing
5. Implement integrated testing framework
