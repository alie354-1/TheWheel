# Business Operations Hub: Remaining Work (Sprints 13-16)

This document summarizes all remaining work for Sprints 13-16, based on the original sprint plans and the current state of the codebase. It also consolidates these into a new sprint plan to complete all outstanding tasks up through Sprint 16.

---

## Sprint 13: Modular Workspace Architecture

### Still To Do
- **Context Adaptation Logic:** `useContextAdaptation` in `WorkspaceContainer.tsx` is still a placeholder. Needs real business/user context detection and dynamic adaptation.
- **Workspace Template Persistence:** `workspaceTemplateService` is not integrated with backend (Supabase/API). All CRUD operations are in-memory only.
- **Template Management UI:** No drag-and-drop or advanced template editing in `WorkspaceTemplateManager.tsx`.
- **Default Templates:** No default templates for common business domains.
- **Unit/Integration Tests:** Lacking for modularity, context adaptation, and template application.

---

## Sprint 14: Cross-Domain Intelligence & Recommendations

### Still To Do
- **Cross-Domain Intelligence Engine:** No implemented logic in `domain.service.ts` for detecting cross-domain dependencies/blockers.
- **Visualization of Dependencies:** No UI for surfacing cross-domain blockers or suggesting resolution steps.
- **Company-Wide Recommendations:** `recommendation.service.ts` does not prioritize company-level actions or provide explanations.
- **Tool Recommendation Guidance:** Step-by-step tool implementation guidance is not fully integrated with task/milestone state.
- **Unit/Integration Tests:** Lacking for cross-domain logic, recommendations, and tool guidance.

---

## Sprint 15: Analytics & Predictive Insights

### Still To Do
- **Custom KPI System:** No UI for defining, tracking, or visualizing custom KPIs.
- **Predictive Analytics:** No time-series forecasting or automated insights in analytics services/components.
- **Feedback & Learning System:** No persistent learning history or adaptive recommendation logic based on feedback.
- **Unit/Integration Tests:** Lacking for analytics, KPIs, predictive insights, and feedback.

---

## Sprint 16: Multi-User, Team, and Knowledge Management

### Still To Do
- **Team Collaboration:** Role assignment, invitations, and access control logic in `TeamManager.tsx` and `accessControl.service.ts` are incomplete or missing.
- **Activity Feeds & Notifications:** No robust activity feed or notification system for team collaboration.
- **Knowledge Management:** `KnowledgeRepository.tsx` and `knowledge.service.ts` lack backend integration, categorization, full-text search, and sharing/permissions.
- **Performance Optimization:** No evidence of caching, lazy loading, or query optimization for key components.
- **Documentation:** No finalized user/developer documentation for new features.
- **Unit/Integration Tests:** Lacking for team, knowledge, and performance features.

# Consolidated Sprint: "Sprint 16X â€“ Phase 2 Completion"

## Goal

Complete all outstanding work from Sprints 13-16 to deliver a fully modular, intelligent, collaborative, and high-performance Business Operations Hub.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workspaces adapt to user/company context dynamically.
- [ ] Workspace templates are persistent, editable, and support drag-and-drop layout.
- [ ] Cross-domain dependencies and blockers are detected, visualized, and actionable.
- [ ] Company-wide recommendations are prioritized and explained.
- [ ] Tool recommendations are contextual and provide step-by-step implementation guidance.
- [ ] Users can define, track, and visualize custom KPIs.
- [ ] Predictive analytics and automated insights are available in dashboards.
- [ ] The system learns from feedback and surfaces learning history.
- [ ] Team members can be invited, assigned roles, and collaborate in real time.
- [ ] Activity feeds and notifications support team workflows.
- [ ] Knowledge repository supports categorization, search, sharing, and permissions.
- [ ] Platform performance is optimized (caching, lazy loading, query optimization).
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation is available for all new features.
- [ ] All new features are covered by unit and integration tests.

## Technical Tasks

- Implement real context adaptation in workspaces.
- Integrate workspace template CRUD with backend (Supabase/API).
- Build advanced template management UI (drag-and-drop, preview).
- Extend domain and recommendation services for cross-domain intelligence and company-wide prioritization.
- Build UI for cross-domain blockers and company-level recommendations.
- Integrate tool guidance with task/milestone state and progress tracking.
- Create custom KPI definition, tracking, and visualization components.
- Implement predictive analytics and automated insights in analytics services.
- Expand feedback system for learning history and adaptive recommendations.
- Complete team collaboration features: invitations, roles, activity feeds, notifications.
- Finalize knowledge management: backend integration, categorization, search, sharing, permissions.
- Optimize performance: caching, lazy loading, query optimization.
- Write and publish user/developer documentation.
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for all new features.
