3. **BOH-401.3**: Automation engine enhancements
   - Backend logic for evaluating conditions and executing multi-step actions
   - Logging and error handling for automation runs

**Acceptance Criteria:**

```gherkin
Scenario: Creating a multi-step automation
Given I am in the automation builder
When I add multiple actions and conditions
Then the automation executes all actions in order when triggered

Scenario: Conditional automation
Given I set up an automation with if/then/else logic
When the trigger occurs
Then the correct branch is executed based on the condition
```
