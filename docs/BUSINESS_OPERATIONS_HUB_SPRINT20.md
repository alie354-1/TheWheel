# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 20 Implementation Plan

## Sprint Goal

Complete Phase 3 by implementing collective intelligence, knowledge sharing, and advanced learning features. This sprint also focuses on surfacing anonymized insights, expert recommendations, and supporting knowledge graph visualization.

---

## Context

- Advanced decision support, scenario modeling, and benchmarking are in place.
- The system should now support collective intelligence, knowledge sharing, and expert-driven recommendations.
- Knowledge graph visualization and anonymized insights need to be surfaced and integrated.

---

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 20.1: Collective Intelligence & Knowledge Sharing

**As** a user  
**I want** to benefit from anonymized insights and recommendations from the broader user base  
**So that** I can learn from the experiences of others

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Collective Intelligence & Knowledge Sharing
  Scenario: Surface anonymized insights and recommendations
    Given the system has aggregated anonymized data from many users
    When a relevant pattern or lesson is detected
    Then I receive an insight or recommendation based on collective intelligence
```

---

### Story 20.2: Expert Recommendations & Community Sourcing

**As** a user  
**I want** to receive recommendations from domain experts and the community  
**So that** I can access best practices and avoid common pitfalls

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Expert Recommendations & Community Sourcing
  Scenario: Receive expert and community recommendations
    Given I am working on a task or decision
    When an expert or community-sourced recommendation is available
    Then it is surfaced in context with attribution and rationale
```

---

### Story 20.3: Knowledge Graph Visualization

**As** a user  
**I want** to visualize the relationships between knowledge, decisions, and outcomes  
**So that** I can better understand the structure and flow of business operations

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Knowledge Graph Visualization
  Scenario: Visualize knowledge and decision relationships
    Given I have a set of knowledge artifacts and decision logs
    When I view the knowledge graph
    Then I see the relationships and can explore connections interactively
```

## Technical Tasks

- Implement collective intelligence aggregation and anonymized insight surfacing
- Build/extend expert recommendation and community sourcing logic and UI
- Develop knowledge graph backend and interactive visualization components
- Integrate collective intelligence and knowledge graph with analytics and learning systems
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for collective intelligence, expert recommendations, and knowledge graph

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/knowledge/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend analytics, learning, and knowledge systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing knowledge repository and reporting infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

---

## References to Extend/Modify

- `src/business-ops-hub/services/knowledge.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/analytics.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/knowledge/KnowledgeGraph.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/RecommendationsPanel.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/feedback/FeedbackReflectionPanel.tsx`

---

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new knowledge or recommendation components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the knowledge graph or collective intelligence logic; build on the new systems.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for collective intelligence, expert recommendations, and knowledge graph
- Add integration tests for anonymized insights and knowledge graph exploration
- Manual QA: Verify collective intelligence, expert recommendations, and knowledge graph features
