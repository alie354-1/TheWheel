## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Drag and drop complexity | High | Medium | Use established libraries, incremental implementation |
| Performance with large datasets | High | Medium | Early virtualization implementation, pagination |
| Real-time synchronization issues | Medium | Medium | Fallback mechanisms, optimistic UI updates |
| Mobile usability challenges | Medium | Low | Mobile-first design approach, dedicated testing |
| Analytics integration complexity | Low | Low | Decoupled implementation, phased rollout |

## Success Criteria

1. All new features successfully implemented and integrated
2. Performance benchmarks met or exceeded (load < 1s, interactions < 100ms)
3. Mobile usability score > 90/100
4. Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
5. All unit and integration tests passing
6. User feedback rating > 4.5/5 for new features

- Tool selection and evaluation workflow
- Detail pages with enhanced functionality
- Advanced collaboration features
- User feedback system
- Premium feature implementation

This revised plan builds on our existing progress while expanding functionality in key areas to create a more powerful, intuitive, and efficient Journey experience.
