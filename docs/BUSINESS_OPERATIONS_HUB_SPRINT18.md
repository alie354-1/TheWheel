# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 18 Implementation Plan

## Sprint Goal

Continue Phase 3 by expanding the learning system, enabling company-wide and cohort-based benchmarking, and surfacing actionable insights and recommendations based on advanced analytics and pattern recognition.

---

## Context

- The learning system, cohort-based pattern recognition, and advanced feedback mechanisms are in place.
- Benchmarking and actionable insights need to be surfaced at the company and cohort level.
- The system should now provide more proactive, data-driven recommendations.

## Technical Tasks

- Extend analytics and learning systems to support benchmarking at company and cohort levels
- Build/extend UI components for benchmarking dashboards and comparison views
- Implement logic to surface actionable insights and recommendations based on analytics and patterns
- Integrate proactive guidance and nudge logic with notification and activity feed systems
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for benchmarking, insights, and nudges

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/analytics/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend analytics, learning, and notification systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing cohort and benchmarking infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

- `src/business-ops-hub/services/analytics.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/learning.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/cohort.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/BenchmarkingDashboard.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/NotificationCenter.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/ActivityFeed.tsx`

---

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new benchmarking or notification components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the analytics or learning system; build on the new benchmarking and nudge logic.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for benchmarking, insights, and nudges
- Add integration tests for actionable recommendations and proactive guidance
- Manual QA: Verify benchmarking, insights, and nudge delivery
