## Introduction

Wheel99 is a platform designed to help entrepreneurs, business strategists, and innovation teams generate, refine, and develop business ideas with AI assistance. The platform democratizes business ideation by providing powerful AI-assisted tools that make the process of generating and developing business ideas more accessible, efficient, and effective.

The platform features three main components:

1. **Idea Playground** - A structured environment for business idea creation and development with multiple pathways for idea refinement
2. **Standup Bot** - AI-powered assistant for conducting effective standups by providing feedback, generating summaries, and suggesting tasks
3. **Task Generation** - Intelligent system for suggesting relevant, context-aware tasks based on user input and project status

By combining structured workflows with contextual AI assistance, Wheel99 helps users transform raw ideas into well-developed business concepts ready for implementation.
