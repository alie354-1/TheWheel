| Performance issues with analytics queries | High | Medium | Implement aggressive caching, pre-aggregation, and query optimization |
| External system integration complexity | Medium | High | Build robust error handling, fallbacks, and detailed logging |
| User privacy concerns with data collection | High | Medium | Implement transparent controls, anonymization, and clear opt-out mechanisms |
| Enterprise customization complexity | Medium | Medium | Create modular architecture with sensible defaults and clear documentation |

## Success Criteria

1. Analytics dashboard loads key metrics in under 3 seconds
