# Deck Builder Resize Handles Fix Summary

## Issue
Components in the deck builder were disappearing when clicked/dragged, and resize handles were not functioning properly.

## Root Cause
The resize functionality was using React hooks (useCallback) which created closure issues, preventing proper access to the current state values during mouse move events.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed useCallback Dependencies
- Replaced `useCallback` hooks with regular function definitions for resize handlers
- This ensures handlers always have access to current state values

### 2. Used Window Properties for State Storage
- Store initial resize values on the window object:
  - `window._initialResizeMouseX/Y`
  - `window._initialResizeWidth/Height`
  - `window._initialResizeX/Y`
- Store event listeners on window for proper cleanup:
  - `window._resizeMouseMoveListener`
  - `window._resizeMouseUpListener`

### 3. Fixed Event Handler Cleanup
- Properly remove event listeners on component unmount
- Clean up listeners when resize ends

### 4. Added Debugging
- Console logs for resize start, move, and end events
- Mouse enter logs for handles
- Detailed logging of resize calculations

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the deck builder
2. Add a component to the slide
3. Click on the component to select it
4. You should see blue resize handles around the component
5. Hover over a handle - check console for "Mouse entered handle [position]" messages
6. Click and drag a handle:
   - Check console for detailed resize logs
   - Component should resize smoothly
   - Component should NOT disappear
7. Release the mouse - resize should complete successfully

## Files Modified

- `src/deck-builder/preview/components/PreviewSlide.tsx` - Main fix for resize functionality
- `src/deck-builder/components/VisualComponentRenderer.tsx` - Previously fixed for drag functionality

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for any error messages
2. Verify no CSS is overriding the handle styles
3. Check if any global event handlers are intercepting mouse events
