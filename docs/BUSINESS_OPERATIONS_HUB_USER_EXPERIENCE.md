# Business Operations Hub: User Experience Design

## User Experience Overview

The Business Operations Hub transforms how founders interact with their business journey by reorienting around business domains, contextual tools, and adaptive priorities. This document outlines the key user experience elements that make the system intuitive, efficient, and powerful.

## Core UX Principles

1. **Business-First Organization**: All interfaces are organized around business functions rather than abstract journey concepts
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is revealed progressively, showing only what's needed at each step
3. **Contextual Intelligence**: Tools and resources appear when and where they're relevant
4. **Frictionless Interaction**: Common tasks require minimal clicks and seamless transitions
5. **Adaptive Learning**: The system evolves based on user behavior and preferences

## Primary User Flows

### Daily Dashboard Flow
