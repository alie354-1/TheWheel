## Key Files

- **Database Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20250316145000_enhanced_profile_completion.sql`
- **Migration Script**: `scripts/run-enhanced-profile-migration.js`
- **Test Data Script**: `scripts/init-profile-sections.js`

## Quick Start

1. **Run the Database Migration**
   ```bash
   node scripts/run-enhanced-profile-migration.js
   ```

2. **Initialize Test Data**
   ```bash
   node scripts/init-profile-sections.js <user-id>
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Compatibility

The Enhanced Profile System is designed to maintain compatibility with existing services:

- **Idea Playground**: All profile references and company associations preserved
- **Standup Bot**: Continued access to profile and company information
- **Task Generation**: Uninterrupted access to user context and preferences

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Onboarding**: Personalized flow based on user roles
- **Comprehensive Profile Management**: Section-based profile organization
- **Profile Completion Tracking**: Visual indicators and completion percentage
- **Notification System**: Milestone notifications and improvement suggestions
- **Multiple Role Support**: Switch between different professional contexts

## Implementation Phases

1. **Database Foundation**: âœ… Complete
2. **Onboarding Flow**: ðŸ”„ In Progress
3. **Profile Builder**: ðŸ“… Upcoming
4. **Integration & Testing**: ðŸ“… Planned

## Architecture

The system utilizes a layered architecture:

- **Database Layer**: Extended profile schema with backward compatibility
- **Services Layer**: Enhanced services with compatibility support
- **UI Components**: Role-based, modular components

## Contributing

1. Reference the `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `USER_STORIES.md` for feature specifications
2. Follow the architectural patterns defined in `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. Implement components according to the phased approach in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing services

## Security Considerations

- All new tables include Row-Level Security policies
- Authentication is required for accessing profile data
- Authorization checks prevent unauthorized profile access
- Input validation is enforced for all profile updates
