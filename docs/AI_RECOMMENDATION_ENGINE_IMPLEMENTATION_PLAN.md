# AI-Powered Recommendation Engine: Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the AI-Powered Recommendation Engine, a key feature in the next phase of the Journey System.

## 1. Project Overview

The AI-Powered Recommendation Engine will provide personalized recommendations to startup founders for journey steps, experts, and templates. This will be achieved by analyzing company data, user behavior, and peer data to deliver tailored guidance.

## 2. Key Features

- **Personalized Journey Steps:** Recommend the most relevant next steps based on a company's profile, progress, and goals.
- **Targeted Expert Matching:** Suggest experts whose skills and experience align with a founder's current challenges.
- **Contextual Template Suggestions:** Offer templates that are most appropriate for a company's industry, stage, and the specific journey step.
- **Continuous Learning:** The system will learn from user interactions and feedback to continuously improve the quality of its recommendations.

## 3. Architecture

The recommendation engine will be built as a new service within the existing architecture.

- **`AiRecommendationService`:** A new TypeScript service responsible for generating recommendations.
- **Integration with OpenAI:** The service will leverage a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's GPT for complex analysis and recommendation generation.
- **New Database Tables:**
    - `recommendation_models`: To store different recommendation algorithms and their configurations.
    - `recommendation_feedback`: To capture user feedback on recommendations (e.g., "Was this helpful?").
    - `user_behavior_analytics`: To track user interactions with recommendations.
- **Caching Layer:** A caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) will be used to store recommendations and reduce latency.

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Sprint 1)

- **Task 1.1: Database Schema Extension**
  - Create the `recommendation_models`, `recommendation_feedback`, and `user_behavior_analytics` tables.
  - Define relationships with existing tables (`users`, `companies`, `journey_steps`, etc.).

- **Task 1.2: `AiRecommendationService` Scaffolding**
  - Create the initial structure for the `AiRecommendationService`.
  - Define the service interface with methods for getting recommendations for steps, experts, and templates.

- **Task 1.3: OpenAI Integration**
  - Set up the OpenAI API client.
  - Create utility functions for making API calls and handling responses.
  - Implement basic prompt engineering for generating simple recommendations.

### Phase 2: Step Recommendations (Sprint 2)

- **Task 2.1: Develop Step Recommendation Algorithm**
  - The algorithm will consider:
    - Company's current journey phase and last completed step.
    - Company profile data (industry, stage, size).
    - Peer data (e.g., what steps other similar companies took next).
- **Task 2.2: Implement `getStepRecommendations` Method**
  - Integrate the algorithm into the `AiRecommendationService`.
- **Task 2.3: UI Integration**
  - Create a new "Recommended for You" section on the `JourneyHomePage`.
  - Display the recommended steps with clear explanations for why they are being suggested.

### Phase 3: Expert and Template Recommendations (Sprint 3)

- **Task 3.1: Develop Expert Recommendation Algorithm**
  - The algorithm will consider:
    - The user's current journey step.
    - The expert's areas of expertise and experience.
    - User feedback on previous expert interactions.
- **Task 3.2: Develop Template Recommendation Algorithm**
  - The algorithm will consider:
    - The user's current journey step.
    - The company's industry and stage.
    - Popularity and ratings of templates.
- **Task 3.3: Implement `getExpertRecommendations` and `getTemplateRecommendations` Methods**
- **Task 3.4: UI Integration**
  - Enhance the existing `ExpertRecommendationPanel` and `TemplateRecommendationPanel` to include AI-powered suggestions.

### Phase 4: Feedback and Learning (Sprint 4)

- **Task 4.1: Implement Feedback Mechanism**
  - Add "Helpful" / "Not Helpful" buttons to recommendations.
  - Create a modal for more detailed feedback.
- **Task 4.2: Store and Analyze Feedback**
  - Save feedback to the `recommendation_feedback` table.
  - Build a simple analytics dashboard to review feedback.
- **Task 4.3: Refine Algorithms**
  - Use feedback data to fine-tune the recommendation algorithms.

## 5. Timeline

- **Sprint 1 (1 week):** Foundational Setup
- **Sprint 2 (2 weeks):** Step Recommendations
- **Sprint 3 (2 weeks):** Expert and Template Recommendations
- **Sprint 4 (1 week):** Feedback and Learning

**Total Estimated Time:** 6 weeks

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate:** Percentage of users who interact with AI-powered recommendations.
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Percentage of recommendations that are clicked on.
- **Helpfulness Score:** Average rating from user feedback.
- **Impact on Journey Progression:** Do users who engage with recommendations complete their journey faster?

I will now start with Phase 1, Task 1.1: creating the new database tables.
