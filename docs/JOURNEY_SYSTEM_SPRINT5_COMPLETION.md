# Journey System - Sprint 5 Completion Summary

**Sprint Goal:** Enhance the Journey system with advanced analytics, AI-driven recommendations, personalization features, enterprise customization options, and performance optimizations.

**Date:** May 5, 2025

---

## Key Objectives Achieved:

1.  **Advanced Analytics Dashboard:**
    *   Implemented core analytics service (`analytics.service.ts`).
    *   Created `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` component structure.
    *   Developed `PredictiveInsightsPanel.tsx` and `MultiDimensionalReporting.tsx` components (initial versions).
    *   **Status:** Foundational components and service created. Requires data integration and UI refinement.

2.  **AI-Powered Journey Optimization:**
    *   Implemented `NextBestSteps.tsx` and `StepRelationshipMap.tsx` components.
    *   Grouped recommendations within `RecommendationsPanel.tsx`.
    *   Integrated `RecommendationsPanel` into `JourneyStepDetails.tsx`.
    *   Updated `CoreRecommendationService` to accept enhanced context (including personalization data).
    *   **Status:** Components integrated. Core service updated to accept personalization context, but scoring logic remains placeholder. Requires implementation of actual recommendation algorithms.

3.  **Personalized Learning Paths:**
    *   Created `learningProfile.service.ts` with functions for fetching, updating, and placeholder analysis (`getUserLearningProfile`, `upsertUserLearningProfile`, `analyzeUserBehavior`, `generatePersonalizedPath`, `getSkillGapRecommendations`).
    *   Implemented `LearningProfileEditor.tsx` and `LearningProfileDisplay.tsx`.
    *   Integrated display and edit functionality into `Profile.tsx`.
    *   Connected `NextBestSteps.tsx` to fetch and pass learning profile data to the recommendation service.
    *   **Status:** UI components and service layer implemented. Personalization data is passed to the recommendation service. Requires implementation of analysis and path generation logic in `learningProfile.service.ts`.

4.  **External Training Integration:**
    *   Created `externalIntegration.service.ts` with placeholder functions for syncing content and tracking progress (`getExternalSystems`, `syncContent`, `trackExternalProgress`, `getRelevantExternalContent`).
    *   **Status:** Service structure defined. Requires implementation of actual API interactions with external systems.

5.  **Enterprise Customization:**
    *   Created `accessControl.service.ts` with placeholder functions for RBAC (`hasPermission`, `getUserRole`, `getRolePermissions`, `assignRole`).
    *   Created `appSettings.service.ts` for managing global and company settings (`getSetting`, `getAllSettings`, `upsertSetting`, `deleteSetting`).
    *   Implemented `AdminAppSettingsPage.tsx` with functionality to display and edit settings.
    *   **Status:** Core services and admin UI for settings management created. Requires implementation of permission checks and potentially more complex setting types/UI.

6.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Created `cache.ts` utility providing basic in-memory caching with TTL and a `withCache` higher-order function.
    *   **Status:** Caching utility implemented. Ready to be applied to relevant service functions.

## Pending Tasks / Next Steps:

*   **Implement Placeholder Logic:** Flesh out the `// TODO:` sections in services (recommendation scoring, personalization analysis, external API calls, RBAC checks).
*   **Data Integration:** Connect analytics components to actual data sources/warehouse.
*   **UI Refinement:** Enhance `AdminAppSettingsPage` (add/delete, filtering), add feedback mechanisms for recommendations.
*   **Testing:** Perform thorough integration and unit testing for all new features.
*   **Documentation:** Finalize user guides and technical documentation.

**Overall Status:** Foundational work for Sprint 5 objectives is largely complete. Key components and services are in place, but require further implementation of core logic (AI models, external APIs, detailed business rules) and comprehensive testing.
