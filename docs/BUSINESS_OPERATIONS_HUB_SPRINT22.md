# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 22 Implementation Plan

## Sprint Goal

Continue Phase 4 by expanding workflow automation, compliance management, and document generation. This sprint also focuses on approval workflows and audit readiness.

---

## Context

- External integrations, calendar sync, and workflow automation foundation are in place.
- The system should now support advanced workflow automation, compliance management, and document generation.
- Approval workflows and audit readiness features are needed for operational maturity.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 22.1: Advanced Workflow Automation

**As** an admin  
**I want** to define multi-step, conditional workflows with approval gates  
**So that** complex business processes can be automated and tracked

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Advanced Workflow Automation
  Scenario: Define and execute multi-step workflows
    Given I am an admin
    When I create a workflow with multiple steps and conditions
    Then it can be triggered, executed, and monitored with approval gates
```

### Story 22.2: Compliance Management & Audit Readiness

**As** a user  
**I want** to track compliance requirements, collect evidence, and prepare for audits  
**So that** my company is always ready for due diligence or regulatory review

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Compliance Management & Audit Readiness
  Scenario: Track compliance and prepare for audits
    Given I have compliance requirements and evidence
    When I use the compliance dashboard
    Then I can track status, collect evidence, and generate audit-ready reports
```

### Story 22.3: Document Generation & Approval Workflows

**As** a user  
**I want** to generate, manage, and route documents for approval  
**So that** contracts, policies, and reports are handled efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Document Generation & Approval Workflows
  Scenario: Generate and approve documents
    Given I need a contract, policy, or report
    When I generate a document and route it for approval
    Then the approval process is tracked and the document is versioned and stored
```

## Technical Tasks

- Extend workflow automation engine to support multi-step, conditional, and approval workflows
- Build/extend compliance management dashboard and evidence collection logic
- Implement document generation, versioning, and approval routing backend and UI
- Integrate audit readiness features with reporting and compliance systems
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for workflow, compliance, and document features

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/workflow/`, `compliance/`, `documents/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend automation, compliance, and document systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing reporting and notification infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new workflow, compliance, or document components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the approval or audit logic; build on the new workflow and compliance systems.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for workflow automation, compliance, and document features
- Add integration tests for approval workflows and audit readiness
- Manual QA: Verify workflow execution, compliance tracking, and document approval
