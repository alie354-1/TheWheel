## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/analytics/`, `bi/`, `kpi/`, `visualization/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend analytics, reporting, and visualization systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing notification and reporting infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props
