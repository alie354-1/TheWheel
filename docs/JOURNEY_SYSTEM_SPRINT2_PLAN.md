## Implementation Details

### Component Migration Strategy

We'll follow these steps for each component:

1. Create wrapper components that use both old and new data sources during transition
2. Update one component at a time, starting with leaf components
3. Implement comprehensive error boundaries for graceful degradation
4. Use feature flags to enable gradual rollout

### Key New Components

1. **InteractiveJourneyMap**
   - Visual representation of the entire journey
   - Interactive navigation between phases and steps
   - Real-time progress visualization
   - Drag-and-drop step reordering

2. **StepRelationshipGraph**
   - Visualize relationships between steps
   - Show dependencies and recommended sequences
   - Highlight completion paths and bottlenecks

3. **JourneyAnalyticsDashboard**
   - Time spent per phase/step
   - Completion rates and bottlenecks
   - Tool selection analytics
   - Custom metrics and KPIs

4. **MilestoneCelebration**
   - Animated celebrations for key achievements
   - Customizable rewards and recognition
   - Social sharing capabilities

### Performance Optimization Techniques

1. **Selective Rendering**
   - Use React.memo for pure components
   - Implement shouldComponentUpdate optimizations
   - Use useCallback for event handlers

2. **Data Loading**
   - Implement data prefetching for common paths
   - Use optimistic UI updates for better UX
   - Implement local caching of journey data

3. **Virtualization**
   - Use virtualized lists for large datasets
   - Implement progressive loading for journey map
   - Optimize image and asset loading

## Success Criteria

1. All existing journey components successfully migrated to new system
2. Performance improvements measured and documented:
   - 30% reduction in initial load time
   - 50% reduction in data transfer for journey pages
   - 40% improvement in interaction responsiveness

3. User experience improvements:
   - Enhanced visualization of journey progress
   - Improved tool selection experience
   - More personalized recommendations

4. Analytics capabilities:
   - Comprehensive tracking of journey interactions
   - Useful insights for both users and admins
   - Performance metrics for continuous improvement

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API incompatibilities discovered | High | Medium | Thorough testing during each component migration, temporary adapters if needed |
| Performance issues with large journeys | High | Medium | Progressive loading, virtualization, optimize queries |
| UX inconsistencies across components | Medium | High | Develop shared component library, UI review checkpoints |
| Mobile responsiveness challenges | Medium | Medium | Mobile-first design approach, device testing matrix |
| Data migration issues | High | Low | Comprehensive testing with production-like data, rollback plan |
