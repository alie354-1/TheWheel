## Integration Requirements

To integrate this dashboard into the actual application, the following tasks must be completed:

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Create a new React component for the main dashboard
   - Create sub-components for:
     - StepsSidebar
     - TabNavigation
     - CurrentWorkTab
     - RecommendedStepsTab
     - BusinessHealthTab
     - StepCard
     - DomainProgressCard
     - PeerInsightCard
   - Implement state management for tab switching

2. **Data Connections**:
   - Connect stats to actual journey step counts
   - Implement real filtering logic
   - Load actual step data for urgent, in-progress, and completed sections
   - Fetch domain progress data from the API
   - Implement real peer insights functionality

3. **State Management**:
   - Track active tab
   - Manage step filtering state
   - Handle sidebar collapsed/expanded state
   - Store and update progress data

4. **Event Handlers**:
   - Add click handlers for all buttons
   - Implement tab switching logic
   - Create step filtering functionality
   - Add search functionality

## API Integration Points

1. **Step Data API**:
   - Fetch active steps
   - Fetch step progress information
   - Update step status
   - Search and filter steps

2. **Domain Progress API**:
   - Fetch domain maturity levels
   - Get domain-specific metrics
   - Retrieve domain recommendations

3. **Peer Insights API**:
   - Fetch relevant peer insights
   - Connect with peer founders

## Testing Strategy

1. **Component Testing**:
   - Unit tests for each individual component
   - Test tab switching functionality
   - Verify sidebar filtering and searching
   - Test responsive behavior

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test data fetching and display
   - Verify all clickable elements work as expected
   - Ensure tabs maintain state during navigation

3. **Cross-browser Testing**:
   - Verify functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Ensure consistent appearance across browsers

4. **Responsive Testing**:
   - Test at multiple viewport sizes:
     - Desktop (1920px)
     - Laptop (1366px)
     - Tablet (768px)
     - Mobile (375px)
   - Verify layout adjustments work correctly

5. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Test keyboard navigation through tabs
   - Verify screen reader compatibility
   - Check color contrast ratios
   - Ensure proper aria attributes for tabs

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Core Structure** (1-2 days)
   - Set up React component hierarchy
   - Implement HTML structure and basic styling
   - Create responsive layout foundation
   - Build tab switching functionality

2. **Phase 2: Data Integration** (2-3 days)
   - Connect to backend APIs
   - Implement data fetching for steps
   - Create domain progress visualization
   - Integrate peer insights

3. **Phase 3: Interactivity & Polish** (2-3 days)
   - Implement all interactive elements
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Refine responsive behavior
   - Polish visual design

4. **Phase 4: Testing & Refinement** (1-2 days)
   - Perform all testing outlined above
   - Fix bugs and issues
   - Optimize performance
   - Finalize documentation

## Key Advantages of This Design

1. **Tabbed Interface Benefits**:
   - Focuses user attention on one context at a time
   - Reduces cognitive load by separating different functional areas
   - Makes mobile adaptation simpler with vertical stacking
   - Provides clear navigation between related content areas

2. **Card-Based Layout Benefits**:
   - Creates visual hierarchy and separation between items
   - Allows for consistent styling and interaction patterns
   - Provides natural containers for related information
   - Scales well across different screen sizes

3. **Cleaner Information Architecture**:
   - Information is grouped by function rather than by visual space
   - Related content stays together in the same tab
   - Primary focus (current work) is highlighted first
   - Secondary information is accessible but not competing for attention

## Notes for Developers

- The current HTML implementation uses Tailwind CSS. When integrating into the main application, adapt the styling to match the project's styling system.
- The tabbed interface requires proper ARIA attributes for accessibility.
- Pay special attention to mobile optimization - test thoroughly on smaller viewports.
- Add loading states for all tab content to handle data fetching delays.
- Consider adding animations for tab transitions to improve user experience.
- The design is more focused on simplicity and clarity compared to option 3, making it potentially more maintainable long-term.
