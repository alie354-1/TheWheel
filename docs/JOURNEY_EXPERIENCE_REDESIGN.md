# Journey Experience Redesign

## Overview

This document outlines the redesigned journey experience for The Wheel platform. The journey section has been revamped to provide a more intuitive, user-friendly experience while maintaining all the powerful functionality that helps companies progress through their business journey.

## Design Goals

1. **Simplify the UX**: Create a cleaner, more straightforward interface that reduces cognitive load
2. **Enhance Discoverability**: Make it easier for users to find the right challenges and tools
3. **Improve Progress Tracking**: Provide clearer visual feedback on journey progress
4. **Focus on Action**: Design an interface that encourages completing challenges and moving forward
5. **Maintain Power**: Keep all functionality but present it in a more digestible way

## Key Improvements

### 1. Challenge-Based Journey Architecture

The journey experience has been refactored from a step-based to a challenge-based architecture. This focuses the user on actionable business challenges rather than abstract journey steps.

Benefits:
- More concrete goals for users to tackle
- Better alignment with business outcomes
- Clearer sense of progress and accomplishment

### 2. Three-View Navigation System

The redesign introduces a three-view navigation system for exploring the journey:

#### Overview View
- High-level progress summary across all phases
- Key metrics and completion percentages
- Quick links to in-progress challenges
- Phase-based progress visualization

#### Challenges View
- Filterable, searchable grid of business challenges
- Visual indicators for difficulty, status, and time investment
- Quick actions for starting, customizing, or marking challenges as irrelevant
- Clean, card-based interface for scanning options

#### Challenge Detail View
- Comprehensive view of a single business challenge
- Clear steps for completion
- Contextual tool recommendations
- Resource links and guidance

### 3. Improved Tool Selection

Tool selection has been greatly simplified:

- Tools are now presented in the context of specific challenges
- Personalized recommendations based on company profile and challenge context
- Clearer comparison of tool options
- Streamlined evaluation process

### 4. Visual Progress Indicators

The redesign implements consistent visual progress tracking:

- Progress bars for overall journey and individual phases
- Status badges for challenges (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Skipped)
- Difficulty indicators to help prioritize work
- Time investment estimates for better planning

### 5. Customization Options

Users can now customize their journey more easily:

- Create custom challenges specific to their business needs
- Modify existing challenges to better fit their context
- Mark irrelevant challenges to declutter the interface
- Personalized recommendations based on previous choices

## Implementation Details

The redesign is implemented through several key components:

1. **ChallengeCard**: Displays individual business challenges with key metadata
2. **ChallengeList**: Renders a collection of challenges with filtering and searching
3. **PhaseProgress**: Visualizes progress through journey phases
4. **ChallengeEditor**: Allows creation and modification of challenges
5. **JourneyOverviewPage**: Provides a dashboard of overall journey progress
6. **JourneyChallengesPage**: Lists all available challenges with filtering options
7. **JourneyStepPage**: Displays detailed view of individual challenges

## Benefits for Different User Types
