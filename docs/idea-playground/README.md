# Idea Playground: Modular Architecture

## Overview

The Idea Playground component of wheel99 has been refactored into a modular architecture to address issues with the previous monolithic implementation. This new architecture improves maintainability, enhances error handling (especially for AI features), and provides a more robust foundation for future development.

## Key Improvements

1. **Modular Architecture**: Services are separated into focused, loosely coupled modules
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Robust fallbacks for AI-related failures
3. **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand, test, and extend
5. **Compatibility**: Maintains API compatibility with existing code

## Migration Guide

To update your code to use the new architecture:

1. Import the service from the new location:
   ```typescript
   // Old
   import { ideaPlaygroundService } from '../services/idea-playground.service';
   
   // New
   import { ideaPlaygroundService } from '../services/idea-playground.service.facade';
   ```

2. Run the migration script to automatically update imports:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/run-modular-idea-playground.sh
   ```

3. Test your application to ensure everything works as expected.

4. For advanced usage, you can access specialized services through the facade:
   ```typescript
   const orchestrator = ideaPlaygroundService.getLLMOrchestrator();
   ```

## Testing

Run the test script to validate the modular implementation:

```bash
node scripts/test-modular-idea-playground.js
```

## AI Features

The new architecture addresses JSON parsing issues and error handling for AI-generated content:

- **Robust Parsing**: Handles malformed JSON from AI responses
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provides sensible defaults when AI services fail
- **Type Validation**: Ensures AI responses are converted to correct types

## Next Steps

Future enhancements to consider:

1. Complete implementation of remaining domain services
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Enhanced AI provider support
4. Performance optimizations
5. Real-time collaboration features
