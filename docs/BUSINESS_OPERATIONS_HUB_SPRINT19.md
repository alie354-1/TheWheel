# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 19 Implementation Plan

## Sprint Goal

Continue Phase 3 by implementing advanced decision support, scenario modeling, and collaborative decision-making features. This sprint also focuses on surfacing decision impact and supporting structured decision logs.

---

## Context

- Benchmarking, actionable insights, and proactive guidance are in place.
- The system should now support advanced decision support, scenario modeling, and collaborative decision-making.
- Decision impact and structured decision logs need to be surfaced and integrated.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 19.1: Advanced Decision Support & Scenario Modeling

**As** a founder  
**I want** to model different scenarios and see the impact of potential decisions  
**So that** I can make more informed, data-driven choices

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Advanced Decision Support & Scenario Modeling
  Scenario: Model scenarios and view impact
    Given I am considering a major decision
    When I use the scenario modeling tool
    Then I can compare different options and see projected outcomes
```

---

### Story 19.2: Collaborative Decision-Making

**As** a team  
**I want** to collaborate on key decisions, share context, and capture rationale  
**So that** our decision-making process is transparent and well-documented

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Collaborative Decision-Making
  Scenario: Collaborate on decisions
    Given I am working with my team
    When we discuss and make a key decision
    Then the context, rationale, and participants are captured in a structured log
```

---

### Story 19.3: Decision Impact & Structured Decision Logs

**As** a user  
**I want** to see the impact of past decisions and maintain structured decision logs  
**So that** I can learn from history and improve future choices

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Decision Impact & Structured Logs
  Scenario: View decision impact and logs
    Given I have made past decisions
    When I review the decision log
    Then I see the impact, outcomes, and lessons learned for each decision
```

---

## Technical Tasks

- Implement scenario modeling tools and UI for decision support
- Build/extend collaborative decision-making features (comments, voting, rationale capture)
- Develop structured decision log backend and UI components
- Integrate decision impact analysis with analytics and learning systems
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for decision support, collaboration, and logs

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/decision/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend analytics, learning, and collaboration systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing activity feed and feedback infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

---

## References to Extend/Modify

- `src/business-ops-hub/services/decision.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/decision/ScenarioModeler.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/decision/DecisionLog.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/feedback/FeedbackReflectionPanel.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/ActivityFeed.tsx`

---

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new decision or collaboration components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the scenario modeling or log logic; build on the new decision support system.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for scenario modeling, decision logs, and collaboration
- Add integration tests for decision impact and structured logs
- Manual QA: Verify scenario modeling, collaborative decisions, and decision log accuracy
