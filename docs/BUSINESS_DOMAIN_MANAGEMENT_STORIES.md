## Notes & Creative Extensions

- **Gamification**: Award badges for adopting best practices or innovative customizations.
- **Industry Benchmarking**: Show how a company's domains/steps compare to industry averages.
- **AI Assistant**: Proactively recommends steps/tools based on company profile and recent changes.
- **Audit Trail**: Full history of all changes for compliance and learning.
- **Export/Import**: Allow companies to export their domain/step structure or import from templates.
- **Collaboration**: Enable comments/discussions on steps for team input.

---

## Example Acceptance Criteria (Detailed)

- When a user adds a global domain, all default steps are copied, and the user can immediately add/remove steps.
- If a user removes a step, the action is logged with user, timestamp, and reason (if provided).
- When a user adds a step, the system checks if this step is commonly added by others and suggests related steps.
- The analytics engine updates suggestions weekly, factoring in new data.
- All recommendations are explainable ("Suggested because 60% of SaaS companies added this step in the last year").
- Privacy: No company-specific data is ever shown to other companies; all analytics are aggregated/anonymized.

## End-to-End Flow

2. Selects a global domain (e.g., "Marketing") — system copies domain and steps
3. Admin customizes steps (adds/removes/edits)
4. All changes are logged
5. System analyzes logs, finds that "Content Calendar" is a common added step
6. Suggestion appears: "Most companies add 'Content Calendar' to Marketing"
7. Admin links a tool (e.g., Trello) to the step
8. Over time, system suggests new steps/tools/resources as patterns emerge
