# Continue Setup Functionality Fix

## Issue Summary

When users clicked "Continue Setup" in the dashboard after partially completing onboarding, they were taken back to the beginning of the onboarding flow rather than continuing from where they left off.

## Root Cause

The problem was in the `OnboardingProgressCard` component where:

1. The "Continue Setup" button used a generic `/onboarding` URL without specifying which persona's onboarding flow to continue
2. The personaId parameter was not being passed from the progress card to the onboarding page
3. Without the personaId, the OnboardingController would start a new onboarding flow

## Implementation Details

### 1. Modified OnboardingProgressCard.tsx

1. Added state to store the personaId:
   ```typescript
   const [onboardingPersonaId, setOnboardingPersonaId] = useState<string | null>(null);
   ```

2. Saved the personaId when fetching onboarding progress:
   ```typescript
   const { needsOnboarding, personaId } = await multiPersonaProfileService.checkOnboardingNeeded(user.id);
   
   if (needsOnboarding && personaId) {
     setActiveOnboarding(true);
     setOnboardingPersonaId(personaId); // Store the personaId for the Continue Setup button
     // ...
   }
   ```

3. Updated the "Continue Setup" button to use the stored personaId:
   ```typescript
   {progress < 100 && onboardingPersonaId && (
     <Link 
       to={`/onboarding/${onboardingPersonaId}`}
       className="inline-flex items-center px-4 py-2 border border-transparent text-sm font-medium rounded-md shadow-sm text-white bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700"
     >
       Continue Setup
     </Link>
   )}
   ```

### 2. Enhanced OnboardingPage.tsx

Added debug logging to make troubleshooting easier:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (personaId) {
    console.log('Resuming onboarding for persona:', personaId);
  } else {
    console.log('Starting new onboarding flow without personaId');
  }
}, [personaId]);
```

### 3. Verified App.tsx Routing

Confirmed that the App's router correctly handles the personaId parameter in both the protected and unprotected routes:

```tsx
// Unprotected routes
<Route path="onboarding/:personaId" element={<OnboardingPage />} />

// Protected routes
<Route path="onboarding/:personaId" element={<OnboardingPage />} />
```

## Testing

To test this fix:
1. Log in to the application
2. Start but do not complete the onboarding process
3. Navigate to the dashboard
4. Verify that the "Continue Setup" button appears
5. Click "Continue Setup"
6. Verify that the onboarding flow resumes from the last step, rather than starting over

## Results

With these changes:
- The "Continue Setup" button properly preserves and passes the personaId
- Clicking the button now takes users back to where they left off in the onboarding process
- The OnboardingController can resume the correct onboarding state and step
