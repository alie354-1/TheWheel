# Deck Builder Interaction Fixes Summary

## Date: June 3, 2025

### Issues Addressed

1. **Components disappearing on click/drag**
2. **Component resize not working properly**
3. **Incorrect coordinate calculations with zoom**
4. **Event propagation issues between components**

### Fixes Implemented

#### Phase 1: Component State Management (UnifiedDeckBuilder.tsx)
✅ **Completed** - Fixed sanitization logic in `handleUpdateComponentLayout`:
- Added proper validation for all layout properties (x, y, width, height, zIndex)
- Ensures all values are finite numbers before updating state
- Prevents NaN and Infinity values from corrupting component state
- Added detailed logging for debugging

#### Phase 2: Event Propagation & Coordinates (PreviewSlide.tsx)
✅ **Completed** - Fixed coordinate calculations in `handleSlideClick`:
- Properly accounts for scroll position when calculating click coordinates
- Uses `getBoundingClientRect()` for reliable positioning
- Correctly scales coordinates by zoom level
- Fixed formula: `(clientX - rect.left + scrollLeft) / zoomLevel`

### Root Causes Identified

1. **State Corruption**: Layout updates were allowing NaN/Infinity values, causing components to disappear
2. **Coordinate Mismatch**: Click coordinates weren't accounting for scroll position in zoomed views
3. **Event Handling**: Complex event propagation between nested components was causing conflicts

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Test component selection and deselection**:
   - Click on components at different zoom levels
   - Click on slide background to deselect
   - Verify components don't disappear

2. **Test component dragging**:
   - Drag components at various zoom levels
   - Ensure smooth movement without disappearing

3. **Test component resizing**:
   - Resize from all 8 handles
   - Test at different zoom levels
   - Verify size constraints are respected

4. **Test with scrolled viewport**:
   - Zoom out and scroll the canvas
   - Verify interactions still work correctly

### Architecture Notes

The deck builder uses a multi-layered architecture:
- `UnifiedDeckBuilder.tsx`: Main orchestrator, manages state
- `PreviewSlide.tsx`: Renders slide canvas and handles resize handles
- `VisualComponentRenderer.tsx`: Renders individual components with drag capability

Key design decisions:
- Resize handles are rendered by PreviewSlide (not individual components)
- All coordinate calculations must account for zoom level
- State updates must be validated to prevent corruption

### Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a coordinate transformation utility to centralize zoom/scroll calculations
2. Add more robust error boundaries around component rendering
3. Implement undo/redo functionality to recover from state issues
4. Add visual feedback during drag/resize operations
