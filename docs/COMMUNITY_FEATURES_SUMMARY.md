# The Wheel Community Features Summary

## Overview

We've designed and implemented a comprehensive community platform for The Wheel that enables portfolio companies to connect, share knowledge, and collaborate effectively. The community features are built to foster meaningful interactions, facilitate knowledge transfer, and create a vibrant ecosystem of founders, executives, and experts.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

We've created a robust database schema that supports all the community features:

- **Tiered Community Structure**: Communities are organized into Core Portfolio, Alumni Network, and Extended Ecosystem tiers
- **Dynamic Group System**: Support for various group types including Stage-Based Cohorts, Functional Excellence Guilds, Industry Chambers, Geographic Hubs, and Special Programs

- **Expert Network**: Expert profiles, endorsements, and verification systems
- **Gamification**: Achievement badges, contribution scoring, and recognition systems
- **Analytics**: Detailed metrics tracking for community health and engagement

The database schema includes proper relationships, indexes for performance, and appropriate data types for all fields.

### 2. TypeScript Types and Interfaces

We've implemented comprehensive TypeScript types and interfaces that:

- Define all data structures used throughout the application
- Provide type safety for all community-related operations
- Include request/response types for API interactions
- Support filtering, pagination, and sorting operations

These types ensure consistency across the application and improve developer experience.
