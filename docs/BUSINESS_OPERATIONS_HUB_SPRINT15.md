# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 15 Implementation Plan

## Sprint Goal

Advance Phase 2 by adding advanced analytics, custom KPI tracking, and predictive insights. This sprint also focuses on enhancing the feedback and learning system for continuous improvement.

---

## Context

- Cross-domain intelligence, company-wide recommendations, and tool guidance are in place.
- Analytics and reporting are available but not yet fully customizable or predictive.
- The feedback and learning system needs to be expanded for deeper impact.

### Story 15.3: Enhanced Feedback & Learning System

**As** a user  
**I want** the system to learn from my feedback and outcomes, and surface learning history  
**So that** recommendations and prioritization improve over time

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Enhanced Feedback & Learning System
  Scenario: System learns and surfaces learning history
    Given I provide feedback on recommendations or outcomes

## Technical Tasks

- Extend analytics and reporting services to support custom KPI definition, tracking, and visualization
- Integrate predictive analytics algorithms and automated insight generation
- Build/extend analytics and reporting UI components for custom KPIs and predictive insights
- Enhance the feedback and learning system to surface learning history and impact
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for analytics, KPIs, predictive insights, and feedback

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/analytics/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend analytics, reporting, and feedback systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing data models and reporting infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

- `src/business-ops-hub/components/AnalyticsPanel.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/dashboardAnalytics.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/recommendation.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/ExecutiveDashboardPanel.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/RecommendationsPanel.tsx`

---

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new analytics or reporting components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the feedback or learning system; build on the new learning history logic.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for analytics, KPIs, predictive insights, and feedback
- Add integration tests for custom KPI tracking and learning history
- Manual QA: Verify analytics, predictive insights, and continuous improvement features
