---

## Context

- Advanced analytics, custom KPIs, predictive insights, and feedback/learning systems are in place.
- The platform is ready for multi-user collaboration and knowledge management.
- Performance and documentation need to be finalized before moving to integrations.

    Then the user receives access according to their permissions
    And team members can collaborate in workspaces
```

**So that** I can capture, organize, and find important business knowledge

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Knowledge Management System
  Scenario: Capture and search knowledge
    Given I have created or uploaded knowledge artifacts

### Story 16.3: Performance Optimization & Documentation

**As** a user  
**I want** the platform to be fast, reliable, and well-documented  
**So that** I have a seamless experience and clear guidance

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Performance Optimization & Documentation
  Scenario: Fast and well-documented platform
    Given I am using the Business Operations Hub
    When I navigate, search, or perform actions
    Then the platform responds quickly
    And I can access up-to-date documentation and help
```

---

## Technical Tasks

- Implement team invitation, role assignment, and access control logic
- Build/extend team collaboration UI and backend (activity feeds, assignments, notifications)
- Develop knowledge management repository, categorization, and search features
- Optimize performance (caching, lazy loading, query optimization, etc.)
- Finalize and publish user/developer documentation for all new features
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for team, knowledge, and performance features

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/team/`, `knowledge/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend collaboration, access control, and knowledge systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing notification and activity feed infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

---

## References to Extend/Modify

- `src/business-ops-hub/services/accessControl.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/team/TeamManager.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/knowledge/KnowledgeRepository.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/knowledge.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/ActivityFeed.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/NotificationCenter.tsx`

---

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new team or knowledge components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the documentation or performance logic; build on the new optimization patterns.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for team, knowledge, and performance features
- Add integration tests for collaboration and knowledge management
- Manual QA: Verify team collaboration, knowledge search, and platform performance
