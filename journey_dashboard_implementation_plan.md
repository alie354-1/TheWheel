- [ ] Status filter checkboxes are clickable
- [ ] Domain filter checkboxes are clickable
- [ ] "Reset" button is clickable
- [ ] "Apply Filters" button is clickable and closes the modal

### 5. Right Panel - Business Health
- [ ] Business Health section displays properly
- [ ] Domain Progress cards display:
  - [ ] Correct maturity level indicators
  - [ ] Appropriate status messages
  - [ ] Proper color coding
- [ ] "View details" and "View all domains" links are clickable
- [ ] Help Card section:
  - [ ] "Ask AI Assistant" button is clickable

## Interactive Features to Test

### 1. Toggle Expand/Collapse Functionality
- [ ] All toggle buttons correctly expand and collapse their sections
- [ ] Icons change appropriately when expanded/collapsed
- [ ] No content overlaps when sections are expanded

### 2. Filtering System
- [ ] Clicking on stat filters:
  - [ ] Updates the visual indication of the active filter
  - [ ] Shows the toast notification
  - [ ] Would filter steps in a real implementation

### 3. Responsive Design Testing
- [ ] Layout maintains integrity on various screen sizes:
  - [ ] Desktop (1920px+)
  - [ ] Laptop (1366px)
  - [ ] Small laptop/large tablet (1024px)
  - [ ] Tablet (768px)
  - [ ] Mobile (375px)
- [ ] Sidebar collapses properly on smaller screens
- [ ] Main content area adjusts for different viewports

## Integration Requirements

To integrate this dashboard into the actual application, the following tasks must be completed:

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Create a new React component structure matching the HTML layout
   - Split the dashboard into reusable sub-components
   - Implement state management for interactive elements

2. **Data Connections**:
   - Connect stats to actual journey step counts
   - Implement real filtering logic
   - Load actual step data for urgent, in-progress, and completed sections
   - Fetch domain progress data from the API
   - Implement real peer insights functionality

3. **Event Handlers**:
   - Add click handlers for all buttons
   - Implement modal open/close logic
   - Add filter application logic
   - Create expand/collapse toggle functionality
   - Implement progress tracking

4. **Styling**:
   - Convert the Tailwind classes to the application's styling system
   - Ensure consistent theming with the rest of the application
   - Add transitions and animations for a polished experience

## Testing Strategy

1. **Component Testing**:
   - Unit tests for each individual component
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Snapshot tests to prevent UI regressions

2. **Interactive Testing**:
   - Manual testing of all clickable elements
   - Verify all toggles, expandable sections, and modals
   - Test filtering and search functionality

3. **Cross-browser Testing**:
   - Verify functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Ensure consistent appearance across browsers

4. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Verify screen reader compatibility
   - Check color contrast ratios
   - Ensure proper aria attributes and semantic HTML

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Core Structure** (1-2 days)
   - Set up React component hierarchy
   - Implement HTML structure and basic styling
   - Create responsive layout foundation

2. **Phase 2: Interactivity** (2-3 days)
   - Implement expand/collapse functionality
   - Create filtering system
   - Build modal functionality
   - Add progress tracking

3. **Phase 3: Data Integration** (2-3 days)
   - Connect to backend APIs
   - Implement data fetching for all components
   - Create real filtering logic

4. **Phase 4: Testing & Refinement** (1-2 days)
   - Perform all testing outlined above
   - Fix bugs and issues
   - Refine animations and transitions
   - Optimize performance

## Notes for Developers

- The current HTML implementation uses Tailwind CSS. When integrating into the main application, adapt the styling to match the project's styling system.
- The modal implementation may need to be replaced with the application's modal system.
- Pay special attention to the expandable panels, as they require careful state management to work correctly.
- The stats filtering toast notifications should be replaced with the application's notification system.
- Consider adding loading states for all data-fetching operations.
