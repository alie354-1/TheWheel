# Journey System Redesign: Current Status

**Date:** May 3, 2025  
**Status:** Sprint 1 - Week 1 Complete

## Overview

We are in the process of unifying our journey system to consolidate the previously separate "steps" and "challenges" concepts into a single cohesive model. This document provides a snapshot of the current status and next steps based on the JOURNEY_SYSTEM_UNIFIED_REDESIGN and JOURNEY_SYSTEM_SPRINT1_DATA_FOUNDATION documents.

## What We've Accomplished

### Week 1 (Completed)

1. **Database Schema**
   - Created unified tables (`journey_steps`, `company_journey_steps`, `step_tools`, `company_step_tools`)
   - Implemented migration scripts to preserve existing data
   - Built adaptive compatibility layer for different environments

2. **Core Service Layer**
   - Implemented `JourneyUnifiedService` with core functionality
   - Created comprehensive unit tests
   - Added tool-related methods and tests

3. **Compatibility Layer**
   - Created dynamic compatibility views to adapt to schema variations
   - Implemented RPC functions for advanced operations
   - Built fallback mechanisms for greater resilience

## Current Challenges

1. **Schema Variations**
   - Different environments have varying column names and structures
   - Solution: Implemented dynamic SQL view generation that adapts at runtime

2. **Company ID Handling**
   - Some tables use `company_id` while others might have different identifiers
   - Solution: Compatibility view handles this by detecting and mapping columns appropriately

3. **Tool Association Migration**
   - Complex relationships between tools, steps, and companies
   - Solution: Multi-stage migration with validation at each step

## What's Next for Week 2

### Monday-Tuesday
- Complete remaining service methods
- Implement React hooks for common operations
- Add comprehensive error handling

### Wednesday
- Complete unified testing framework
- Finalize compatibility layer testing
- Address any issues found during testing

### Thursday-Friday
- Create documentation for developers
- Begin UI component updates
- Plan for Sprint 2 (UI migration)

## Key Insights

1. The adaptive compatibility approach provides more stability across environments than a static approach would have.

2. The mock-based testing strategy is working well, allowing us to test service logic independently from database specifics.

3. The dynamic SQL approach to compatibility views has proven very useful for accommodating database variations.

## Recommendation

Based on our progress, we should:

1. Continue with the unified approach as planned
2. Add more diagnostic logging to the compatibility layer
3. Emphasize documentation for developers during Week 2
4. Begin planning for UI component migration in Sprint 2

## Success Criteria for Sprint 1

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Unified data model | âœ… Complete | Implemented in schema migrations |
| Service layer | ðŸ”¶ In Progress | Core methods complete, some advanced methods pending |
| Compatibility layer | âœ… Complete | Dynamic views and functions implemented |
| Unit tests | ðŸ”¶ In Progress | Base tests complete, some advanced tests pending |
| Documentation | ðŸ”¶ In Progress | Migration guide created, API docs pending |

## Important Files and Components

1. **Service Layer**
   - `src/lib/services/journey-unified.service.ts` - Main service for the unified system
   - `src/tests/journey-unified.service.test.ts` - Unit tests for core functionality
   - `src/tests/journey-unified-tools.test.ts` - Tool-specific unit tests

2. **Database Migration**
   - `supabase/migrations/20250505000000_journey_system_unification.sql` - Core schema migration
   - `supabase/migrations/20250505040000_add_compatibility_layer.sql` - Compatibility views and functions

3. **Documentation**
   - `docs/JOURNEY_SYSTEM_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Guide for developers to migrate their code
   - `docs/JOURNEY_SYSTEM_SPRINT1_SUMMARY.md` - Overall Sprint 1 progress summary

4. **Scripts**
   - `scripts/test-journey-migration.js` - Test script to verify migration success
   - `scripts/migrate-journey-data.cjs` - Data migration utility
   - `scripts/migrate-tools-final.cjs` - Tool association migration

## Conclusion

Sprint 1 Week 1 has successfully established the foundation for the unified journey system. The adaptive approach to compatibility addresses the variation in our database schema effectively. Week 2 should focus on completing the service layer and preparing for UI migration in Sprint 2.

With the compatibility layer in place, we can continue the migration without disrupting existing functionality. The dynamic nature of our compatibility views provides resilience against schema variations, which will be valuable as we transition.
