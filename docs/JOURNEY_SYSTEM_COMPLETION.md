   - Created a migration script for transferring data from the old system to the new system

3. **UI Components**:
   - Updated the JourneyHomePage component to display recommendation panels
   - Added Expert Recommendation Panel, Template Recommendation Panel, and Peer Insights Panel
   - Enhanced the step detail view with recommendations and insights

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created implementation guides and documentation
   - Developed a strategic roadmap for future enhancements
   - Provided recommendations for startup founders
   - Analyzed the system from a founder's perspective

5. **Scripts**:
   - Created scripts for applying the journey integration system
   - Added scripts for applying sample data
   - Made scripts executable
