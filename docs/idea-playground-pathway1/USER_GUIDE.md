#### Understanding Idea Variation Cards

Each AI-generated idea variation card contains:

- **SWOT Analysis**: Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
- **Additional Details**: Revenue streams, cost structure, key metrics, etc.

Each card has three primary actions:
- **Select**: Choose this variation to continue with
- **Edit**: Manually modify the details of this variation
- **Regenerate**: Ask the AI to create a new version of this specific variation

Click on any card to expand and see all details about that variation.

### Step 3: Work with Variations

You have several options at this step:

#### Option A: Select a Single Variation

If you're not fully satisfied with a particular variation:

2. Wait while the AI creates an improved version of that specific concept
3. Review the regenerated variation with all its updated details

#### Option C: Edit a Variation Manually

If you want to make specific changes to a variation:

1. Click the "Edit" button on that variation's card
2. Make your desired changes to any fields
3. Click "Save Changes" to update the variation

#### Option D: Merge Multiple Variations

### Step 4: Merge Variations (if merging)

If you chose to merge multiple variations:

1. The system will show you an AI-generated merged concept that combines elements from your selected variations
2. You can edit any aspect of the merged concept if desired
3. You'll see which source variations contributed to different aspects of the merged idea
4. Click "Save Merged Concept" when you're satisfied

The merged concept will automatically include:
- A title indicating it's a merged concept
- A description that explains the hybrid approach
- Elements drawn from each source variation
- A comprehensive SWOT analysis
- Full business details derived from the source variations
