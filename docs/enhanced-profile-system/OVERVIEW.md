## Getting Started

### For Developers

1. **Run the Database Migration**
   ```bash
   node scripts/run-enhanced-profile-migration.js
   ```

2. **Testing Onboarding**
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-initial-onboarding.js
   ```
   This script resets the onboarding state for the mock user, allowing you to test the full onboarding flow.

2. **Explore the Documentation**
   - `docs/enhanced-profile-system/REQUIREMENTS.md` - Detailed requirements
   - `docs/enhanced-profile-system/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical design
   - `docs/enhanced-profile-system/USER_STORIES.md` - User stories and acceptance criteria
   - `docs/enhanced-profile-system/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Phase-by-phase implementation plan

3. **Understanding the Code**
   - The SQL migration in `supabase/migrations/20250316145000_enhanced_profile_completion.sql`
   - Type definitions for the new profile system (upcoming)
   - Component architecture and service implementations (upcoming)

### For Product Stakeholders

The Enhanced Profile System addresses several key business objectives:

1. **Improved User Onboarding**
   - Reduces time-to-value for new users
   - Increases completion rates through personalization
   - Enables better feature discovery based on user needs

2. **Enhanced User Profiling**
   - Creates richer user profiles for better matching and recommendations
   - Supports multiple roles to reflect user reality
   - Improves information organization and accessibility

3. **Platform Growth Support**
   - Scalable architecture for future user types and roles
   - Extensible sections for additional profile information
   - Analytics foundation for understanding user needs

## Compatibility Considerations

The Enhanced Profile System is designed to maintain compatibility with:

- **Idea Playground:** All profile references and company associations preserved
- **Standup Bot:** Continued access to profile and company information
- **Task Generation:** Uninterrupted access to user context and preferences

### Temporary Feature Limitations

- **Persona Selection:** The persona selection functionality has been temporarily disabled during the onboarding overhaul
- **Multi-Persona Support:** While still available in the database schema, the UI components for multi-persona management have been hidden until the core onboarding flow is stabilized

This is achieved through:

1. Non-destructive schema changes
2. Compatibility database views
3. Service layer adapters
4. Feature flag-based rollout

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining implementation phases
2. Conduct comprehensive testing with existing services
3. Develop user migration strategy for existing profiles
4. Create user documentation and support resources
5. Plan phased rollout with monitoring
