# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 14 Implementation Plan

## Sprint Goal

Continue Phase 2 by integrating cross-domain intelligence, enabling company-wide recommendations, and expanding the tool recommendation and implementation guidance system.

---

## Context

- Workspaces are now modular and context-adaptive.
- Cross-domain intelligence and company-wide recommendations are in early stages.
- Tool recommendation and implementation guidance need to be expanded for deeper integration.

---

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 14.1: Cross-Domain Intelligence v2

**As** a founder  
**I want** the system to identify and surface cross-domain dependencies and blockers  
**So that** I can resolve issues that impact multiple areas of my business

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Cross-Domain Intelligence v2
  Scenario: Surface cross-domain blockers
    Given I have tasks or milestones in multiple domains
    When a dependency or blocker exists across domains
    Then the system highlights it and suggests resolution steps
```

### Story 14.2: Company-Wide Recommendations Engine

**As** a founder  
**I want** a centralized engine that prioritizes the most impactful next steps for the company  
**So that** I can focus on what matters most at the company level

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Company-Wide Recommendations Engine
  Scenario: Prioritize company-level next actions
    Given I have completed, blocked, or at-risk items across domains
    When I view the executive dashboard
    Then I see a prioritized list of company-wide next actions
    And each recommendation includes an explanation
```

### Story 14.3: Tool Recommendation & Implementation Guidance v2

**As** a user  
**I want** tool recommendations to be surfaced at the right time and place, with step-by-step implementation guidance  
**So that** I can adopt the best tools for my business needs

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Tool Recommendation & Implementation Guidance v2
  Scenario: Contextual tool recommendations and guides
    Given I am working on a task or milestone
    When a relevant tool is available
    Then the system recommends it in context
    And provides step-by-step implementation guidance
```

---

## Technical Tasks

- Enhance cross-domain intelligence engine to detect and surface dependencies/blockers
- Expand company-wide recommendations engine with prioritization and explanations
- Integrate tool recommendation logic with context detection and task/milestone state
- Extend implementation guide UI to support step-by-step walkthroughs and progress tracking
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for cross-domain logic, recommendations, and tool guidance

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/dashboard/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend intelligence, recommendation, and tool systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing analytics and reporting infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

---

## References to Extend/Modify

- `src/business-ops-hub/services/dashboardAnalytics.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/recommendation.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/ExecutiveDashboardPanel.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/ToolImplementationGuide.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/RecommendationsPanel.tsx`

---

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new intelligence or recommendation components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the tool guidance system; build on the new step-by-step logic.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for cross-domain intelligence and recommendations
- Add integration tests for tool recommendation and implementation guidance
- Manual QA: Verify company-wide recommendations, cross-domain blockers, and tool guidance
