- Address any operational issues

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies

1. **Supabase Availability**: System relies on Supabase for data storage
2. **OpenAI API Stability**: Changes to OpenAI's API may require updates
3. **React Component Integration**: Requires coordination across the frontend codebase
4. **Legal Review**: Privacy features should be reviewed by legal counsel

### Risks

1. **Performance Impact**: Logging may impact application performance
   - Mitigation: Asynchronous logging, batching, and performance optimization
   
2. **Data Volume Growth**: Log data may grow rapidly
   - Mitigation: Implement retention policies and archiving strategies
   
3. **Privacy Compliance Changes**: Regulations may change
   - Mitigation: Design flexible architecture that can adapt to new requirements
   
4. **User Resistance**: Users may disable consent options
   - Mitigation: Clear communication about benefits and transparent data usage

## Success Metrics

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Complete Coverage**: All system interactions are properly logged
2. **Performance Goals**: Logging adds <50ms overhead to operations
3. **Privacy Compliance**: System meets all GDPR and CCPA requirements
4. **User Control**: Users can easily manage their privacy settings
5. **Data Utility**: Captured data successfully drives model training and insights

## Maintenance Plan

After initial implementation, the following ongoing activities will be required:

1. **Regular Audits**: Quarterly privacy compliance reviews
2. **Data Quality Monitoring**: Ongoing validation of log data quality
3. **Pattern Updates**: Regular updates to data classification patterns
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of system performance
5. **User Feedback**: Collection and incorporation of user feedback
