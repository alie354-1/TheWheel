}
```

### Recommendation Service

The Recommendation Service (`src/lib/services/recommendation/index.ts`) provides the following functionality:

```typescript
interface RecommendationService {
  // Expert recommendations
  getExpertRecommendations(stepId: string): Promise<ExpertRecommendation[]>;
  
  // Template recommendations
  getTemplateRecommendations(stepId: string): Promise<TemplateRecommendation[]>;
  
  // Peer insights
  getPeerInsights(stepId: string): Promise<PeerInsight[]>;

8. `supabase/apply_all_journey_system_changes.sh`: Applies all journey system changes

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Data Migration

**Problem**: Migrating data from the old system to the new system without losing any information.

**Solution**: Created a migration script that carefully maps data from the old tables to the new tables, ensuring that all relationships are preserved.

### Challenge 2: Integration with Expert System

**Problem**: Integrating the Journey System with the Expert Connection System to provide expert recommendations.

**Solution**: Created a clear interface between the two systems, with the Journey System using the Expert Connection System's API to retrieve expert profiles and handle connection requests.

### Challenge 3: Performance Optimization

**Problem**: Ensuring that the Journey System performs well with a large number of steps and recommendations.

**Solution**: Implemented efficient database queries and caching strategies to minimize database load and improve response times.

### Challenge 4: User Experience

**Problem**: Creating a user interface that is intuitive and easy to use, while still providing all the necessary functionality.

**Solution**: Designed clean, focused UI components that present information in a clear and organized way, with a focus on the most important actions for each step.

## Future Technical Enhancements

1. **AI-Powered Recommendations**:
   - Integration with OpenAI API
   - Machine learning models for personalized recommendations
   - Natural language processing for content generation

2. **Journey Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Data visualization components
   - Real-time analytics processing
   - Benchmarking algorithms

3. **Mobile Experience**:
   - React Native implementation
   - Offline data synchronization
   - Push notification system

## Conclusion

The Journey System provides a comprehensive technical solution for guiding startup founders through the process of building a successful startup. The layered architecture, robust data model, and integration with other systems create a flexible and extensible platform that can evolve to meet the changing needs of founders.

The implementation follows best practices for TypeScript and React development, with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and performance. The use of Supabase for the database layer provides a solid foundation for data storage and retrieval, with real-time capabilities for a responsive user experience.
