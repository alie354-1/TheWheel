# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 11 Implementation Plan

## Sprint Goal

Deliver cross-domain intelligence and company-wide recommendations, and introduce the first version of the executive dashboard. All work must extend the modular dashboard and intelligence systems from previous sprints.

---

## Context

- The dashboard is modular, and the task engine and decision intelligence system are in place.
- There is no unified executive view or cross-domain prioritization yet.
- Company-wide recommendations and risk/priority surfacing are not yet implemented.

---

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 11.1: Cross-Domain Intelligence Engine

**As** a founder  
**I want** the system to synthesize insights from all domains  
**So that** I receive company-level recommendations and can see cross-domain blockers

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Cross-Domain Intelligence
  Scenario: Company-level recommendations
    Given I have multiple active domains and tasks
    When I view the executive dashboard
    Then I see prioritized company-wide next actions
    And I see blockers and dependencies across domains
```

---

### Story 11.2: Executive Dashboard

**As** a founder  
**I want** an executive dashboard with a macro view of progress, risk, and urgent items  
**So that** I can focus on what matters most for the company

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Executive Dashboard
  Scenario: Macro view of company status
    Given I am on the executive dashboard
    Then I see a summary of completed, at-risk, blocked, and urgent items
    And I see recommendations for what to address this week
```

---

### Story 11.3: Adaptive Guidance & Risk Surfacing

**As** a user  
**I want** the system to highlight skipped or risky items at the company level  
**So that** I donâ€™t miss critical steps across domains

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Adaptive Guidance
  Scenario: Highlighting skipped or risky items
    Given I have skipped or delayed important tasks
    When I view the executive dashboard
    Then the system highlights these items and explains the risk
```

---

## Technical Tasks

- Implement cross-domain intelligence engine in the backend/service layer
  - Aggregate task, milestone, and risk data across all domains
  - Calculate company-level priorities and blockers
- Build/extend the `ExecutiveDashboardPanel` component
  - Display macro progress, risk, blockers, and urgent items
  - Integrate company-wide recommendations and explanations
- Add adaptive guidance logic to surface skipped or risky items
  - Highlight and explain risks in the executive dashboard UI
- Update analytics and reporting to support company-level views
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for cross-domain logic and executive dashboard

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/dashboard/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend the intelligence and dashboard systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing analytics and reporting infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

## References to Extend/Modify

- `src/business-ops-hub/components/ExecutiveDashboardPanel.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/dashboardAnalytics.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/domain.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/RecommendationsPanel.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/ToolValueDashboard.tsx`

---

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new analytics or dashboard components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the intelligence system; build on the new cross-domain logic.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for cross-domain intelligence and executive dashboard
- Add integration tests for company-level recommendations and risk surfacing
- Manual QA: Verify executive dashboard accuracy, cross-domain blockers, and adaptive guidance
