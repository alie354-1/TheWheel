# Journey Maturity-Based Tracking System

## Overview

We've reimagined how founders track progress on their startup journey. Instead of using completion percentages (which imply a journey that can be "finished"), we've implemented a maturity-based approach that acknowledges the continuous, evolving nature of building a startup.

## The Philosophy: "The Startup Journey is Never Complete"

Startups constantly evolve and adapt. A founder's journey isn't about reaching a final destination where everything is "100% complete" - it's about continuous growth, learning, and adaptation. 

Our new tracking system embraces this reality by focusing on:

- **Maturity levels** rather than completion percentages
- **Current state** of engagement rather than "percentage done"
- **Time invested** rather than "time to completion"

## Maturity Levels

The system tracks domain maturity across five levels:

1. **Exploring**: Initial investigation and learning in a domain
2. **Learning**: Active acquisition of knowledge and skills
3. **Practicing**: Regular application of knowledge and iteration
4. **Refining**: Optimizing processes and deepening expertise
5. **Teaching**: Mastery level where founders can guide others

## Current State

For each domain, we track a current engagement state:

- **Active Focus**: Currently prioritizing work in this domain
- **Maintaining**: Regularly attending to this domain, but not the primary focus
- **Future Focus**: Planned for upcoming work
- **Dormant**: Not currently working in this domain

## Benefits of the New Approach

- **Realistic Representation**: Better reflects the true nature of the startup journey
- **Growth Mindset**: Encourages continuous improvement rather than "checking boxes"
- **Holistic View**: Shows engagement across domains without artificial completion metrics
- **Reduced Anxiety**: Removes pressure to reach "100% completion" in areas that naturally evolve

## Implementation

The new system is implemented across the platform:

- The dashboard displays maturity levels visually rather than progress bars
- Domain progress is shown as maturity levels with engagement metrics
- Reports and analytics focus on growth and engagement rather than completion
