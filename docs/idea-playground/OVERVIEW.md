## Major System Components

### 1. Idea Generation System
- Core idea generation capabilities
- Modular architecture with swappable LLM adapters
- Abstraction layers for different AI models

### 2. Feedback Collection Framework
- Comprehensive tracking of all user interactions
- Classification of feedback into multiple categories
- Storage of metadata for training signal extraction

### 3. IP Protection Layer
- Protection levels for different idea stages
- Owner/team access controls
- Training exclusion mechanisms
- Similarity detection to prevent IP leakage

### 4. Training Pipeline
- Data collection and preparation
- Filtering and obfuscation of sensitive data
- Training supervision with continuous learning
- Model versioning and deployment

### 5. Hugging Face Integration
- Model hosting and serving
- Training infrastructure
- Model registry and versioning
