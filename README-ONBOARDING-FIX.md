# Onboarding Wizard Fix

## Overview

This repository contains fixes for the Wheel99 onboarding wizard that was experiencing a blinking/flickering issue when users navigated through the onboarding steps.

## Issue

The onboarding wizard screens were blinking and not progressing properly through the wizard steps. Users reported:

- Screens flashing/blinking rapidly between steps
- Wizard getting stuck on certain steps
- Needing to click buttons multiple times to progress

## Solution

We implemented several key fixes to address these issues:

1. Fixed infinite re-rendering loops in React component lifecycle
2. Added protection against race conditions in asynchronous operations
3. Implemented state stabilization to prevent UI flickering
4. Enhanced error handling for failed API calls
5. Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

The primary fix is in `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingController.tsx`, which now uses:

- React refs to track API call status
- useCallback for memoized function references
- Controlled fetch effects to prevent duplicate API calls
- Transition protection to prevent rapid state changes
- Debounced loading states to prevent flickering

## Testing

We've created testing tools to verify the onboarding flow works correctly:

- `scripts/test-onboarding-flow.js`: JavaScript test script that monitors the onboarding state
- `scripts/run-onboarding-test.sh`: Bash script to execute the test with proper Node.js options

### How to Test

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed
2. Configure your `.env` file with Supabase credentials
3. Run the test script:

```bash
./scripts/run-onboarding-test.sh
```

4. Log in with the test user credentials provided by the script
5. Go through the onboarding flow to verify it works smoothly
6. Press Ctrl+C in the terminal when done testing

## Documentation

For more detailed information about the fixes, refer to:

- [Blinking Fix Documentation](docs/onboarding-wizard/BLINKING_FIX.md): Technical details about the implemented fixes
- [Onboarding Controller Code](src/components/onboarding/OnboardingController.tsx): The main component that was fixed

## Implementation Summary

The key strategy was to prevent cascading state updates and provide better control over asynchronous operations. We used React's useRef, useCallback, and controlled effects to ensure that state updates happen in a predictable order and that API calls don't trigger unexpected re-renders.

These fixes should result in a much smoother onboarding experience for users, with no more blinking screens or navigation issues.
