# Hugging Face Integration Removal

This document outlines the steps taken to completely remove both the Hugging Face Spaces and standard Hugging Face API integrations from the application.

## Background

The Hugging Face integration was initially added to provide alternative LLM capabilities through both the Hugging Face Inference API and Hugging Face Spaces. After evaluation, we've decided to standardize solely on OpenAI's API for LLM functionality, which offers better reliability, performance, and feature compatibility with our application.

## Archive Script

The `scripts/archive-huggingface-integration.cjs` script has been created to archive all Hugging Face related files. This script:

1. Moves all Hugging Face related source files, components, services, scripts, and documentation to an `archive/huggingface` directory
2. Preserves the file structure within the archive for potential future reference
3. Lists the core files that need manual modifications to remove remaining references

## Running the Archive Script

To archive all Hugging Face related files:

```bash
node scripts/archive-huggingface-integration.cjs
```

## Manual Code Modifications Required

After running the archive script, the following files need to be modified to remove remaining references to Hugging Face:

### 1. src/lib/services/general-llm.service.ts

Remove:
- Imports related to Hugging Face services
- The section in `getLLMService()` that checks for and returns Hugging Face services
- Any other references to Hugging Face in the code

### 2. src/lib/store.ts

Remove:
- Hugging Face related feature flags from the `defaultFeatureFlags` object:
  - `useHuggingFace`
  - `useHFCompanyModel`
  - `useHFAbstractionModel`

### 3. src/components/admin/FeatureFlagsSettings.tsx

Remove:
- The 'AI Providers' section from the `featureGroups` array that references Hugging Face

### 4. src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx

Remove:
- The import of `HuggingFaceSettings` component
- The `<HuggingFaceSettings />` component from the Integrations tab

## Database Cleanup (Optional)

For complete removal, you may want to remove Hugging Face related entries from the database:

1. The `huggingface_spaces` entry in the `app_settings` table
2. The `useHuggingFace`, `useHFCompanyModel`, and `useHFAbstractionModel` feature flags

## Verification Steps

After completing these changes, you can verify that the Hugging Face integration has been fully removed by:

1. Checking that no Hugging Face imports or references remain in the codebase
2. Confirming the application still functions normally
3. Verifying no Hugging Face options appear in the admin settings panels
4. Testing that the LLM service falls back to OpenAI or mock services as expected

## Impact on Application

Removing the Hugging Face integration simplifies the codebase and reduces dependencies. The application will now exclusively use:

- OpenAI's API for production LLM needs
- Mock services for testing and development

This change does not affect any core functionality, as OpenAI remains the primary LLM provider, with Hugging Face having been an optional alternative.
