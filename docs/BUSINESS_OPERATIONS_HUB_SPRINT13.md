# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 13 Implementation Plan

## Sprint Goal

Begin Phase 2: Advanced Workspaces & Priority Engine. This sprint focuses on deepening workspace modularity, enabling context adaptation, and laying the groundwork for cross-domain intelligence and company-wide recommendations.

---

## Context

- The executive dashboard, analytics, and feedback loop are in place.
- Workspaces are not yet fully modular or context-adaptive.
- Cross-domain intelligence and company-wide recommendations need further development.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 13.1: Modular Workspace Architecture

**As** a user  
**I want** each workspace to be fully modular and independently upgradable  
**So that** new features and layouts can be added without affecting other domains

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Modular Workspace Architecture
  Scenario: Workspaces are modular
    Given I am in a workspace
    When a new feature or layout is released
    Then it can be added or updated without impacting other workspaces
```

---

### Story 13.2: Context Adaptation in Workspaces

**As** a user  
**I want** workspaces to adapt their content and tools based on my current activity and business context  
**So that** I always see the most relevant information

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Context Adaptation in Workspaces
  Scenario: Workspace adapts to business context
    Given my company context or activity changes
    When I enter a workspace
    Then the workspace content and tools update to match my needs
```

---

### Story 13.3: Workspace Template System

**As** an admin  
**I want** to define and manage workspace templates  
**So that** I can standardize best practices and layouts across domains

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Workspace Template System
  Scenario: Admin manages workspace templates
    Given I am an admin
    When I create or update a workspace template
    Then it is available for use in new or existing workspaces
```

---

## Technical Tasks

- Refactor workspace container and related components for full modularity
- Implement context detection logic and dynamic content loading in workspaces
- Build workspace template management UI and backend
- Update workspace state management to support template application and context switching
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for modularity, context adaptation, and templates

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/workspace/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend workspace and context logic from previous sprints; do not duplicate
- Use React context or Redux for workspace state and template management
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

---

## References to Extend/Modify

- `src/business-ops-hub/components/workspace/WorkspaceContainer.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/workspaceTemplate.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/WorkspaceTemplateManager.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/StepList.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/RecommendationsPanel.tsx`

---

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new workspace or context components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the template system; build on the new modular architecture.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for workspace modularity and context adaptation
- Add integration tests for template management and application
- Manual QA: Verify workspace modularity, context switching, and template usage
