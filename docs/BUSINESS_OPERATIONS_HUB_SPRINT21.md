# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 21 Implementation Plan

## Sprint Goal

Begin Phase 4: Integration & Business Intelligence. This sprint focuses on integrating with external tools, vendors, and calendars, and laying the foundation for workflow automation and compliance management.

---

## Context

- Collective intelligence, knowledge sharing, and advanced learning features are in place.
- The system is ready to connect with external services and automate business workflows.
- Compliance management and business intelligence features are needed for the next stage.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 21.1: External Tool & Vendor Integration

**As** a user  
**I want** to connect external tools and vendors to the Business Operations Hub  
**So that** I can sync data, automate processes, and manage integrations in one place

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: External Tool & Vendor Integration
  Scenario: Connect and manage integrations
    Given I have access to external tools or vendors
    When I connect an integration
    Then data is synced and workflows can be automated
    And I can manage integration health and settings
```

---

### Story 21.2: Calendar Integration

**As** a user  
**I want** to sync tasks, milestones, and events with my calendar  
**So that** I can manage my schedule and deadlines seamlessly

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Calendar Integration
  Scenario: Sync tasks and milestones with calendar
    Given I have tasks and milestones in the hub
    When I connect my calendar
    Then relevant items are synced and updated in both systems
```

---

### Story 21.3: Workflow Automation Foundation

**As** an admin  
**I want** to define and manage automated workflows  
**So that** routine processes are streamlined and less manual work is required

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Workflow Automation Foundation
  Scenario: Define and manage workflows
    Given I am an admin
    When I create or update a workflow
    Then it can be triggered by events or schedules
    And I can monitor workflow execution and results
```

---

## Technical Tasks

- Implement external tool and vendor integration framework (OAuth, API connectors, sync logic)
- Build/extend UI for managing integrations and monitoring health/status
- Develop calendar integration logic and UI for task/milestone sync
- Implement workflow automation backend and UI for defining, triggering, and monitoring workflows
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for integrations, calendar sync, and workflow automation

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/integrations/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend integration, automation, and calendar systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing notification and activity feed infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

---

## References to Extend/Modify

- `src/business-ops-hub/services/externalIntegration.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/integrations/IntegrationManager.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/calendarIntegration.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/integrations/CalendarSyncPanel.tsx`
- `src/business-ops-hub/services/workflowAutomation.service.ts`
- `src/business-ops-hub/components/WorkflowAutomationManager.tsx`

---

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new integration or automation components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the calendar or workflow logic; build on the new integration systems.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for integrations, calendar sync, and workflow automation
- Add integration tests for external tool and vendor connections
- Manual QA: Verify integration management, calendar sync, and workflow automation
