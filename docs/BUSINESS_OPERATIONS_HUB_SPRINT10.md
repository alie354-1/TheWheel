# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 10 Implementation Plan

## Sprint Goal

Advance the intelligence layer by expanding the priority-driven task engine, introducing the first version of the decision intelligence system, and improving contextual workspace containers. All work must extend the existing codebase and new dashboard foundation from Sprint 9.

---

## Context

- The dashboard is now modular, and the first version of the priority-driven task engine is in place.
- There is no true decision intelligence system or learning from user feedback yet.
- Workspaces are not yet context-aware or adaptive.

---

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 10.1: Priority-Driven Task Engine v2

**As** a founder  
**I want** the task engine to consider historical user behavior and manual overrides  
**So that** my task list adapts to how I work and what I value

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Advanced Priority-Driven Task Engine
  Scenario: Task list adapts to user behavior
    Given I have completed or skipped tasks in the past
    When I view my prioritized task list
    Then the order reflects my historical behavior and any manual priority overrides
```

---

### Story 10.2: Decision Intelligence System v1

**As** a founder  
**I want** the system to track my decisions and outcomes  
**So that** it can improve future recommendations and learn from what works

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Decision Intelligence System
  Scenario: Decisions and outcomes are tracked
    Given I make a key decision or complete a milestone
    When I provide feedback or the outcome is recorded
    Then the system logs the decision and outcome
    And future recommendations are adjusted accordingly
```

---

### Story 10.3: Contextual Workspace Containers

**As** a user  
**I want** each workspace to adapt its layout and content based on my current context (planning, execution, review)  
**So that** I always see the most relevant tools, tasks, and resources

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Contextual Workspace Containers
  Scenario: Workspace adapts to context
    Given I am in a workspace
    When my context changes (e.g., from planning to execution)
    Then the workspace layout and content update to match the new context
```

---

## Technical Tasks

- Enhance the task service to include historical user behavior and manual priority overrides in the priority calculation
- Add UI for users to manually override task priority, with clear explanations and undo
- Implement the first version of the decision intelligence system:
  - Track key decisions and outcomes in the database (additive schema changes only)
  - Integrate feedback capture into the UI (e.g., after completing a task or milestone)
  - Adjust recommendations based on logged outcomes
- Refactor workspace container components to support context detection and dynamic layout/content
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for new intelligence and workspace features

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend the dashboard and task engine from Sprint 9; do not duplicate logic
- Use React context or Redux for workspace context management
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

---

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new workspace or task components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the intelligence system; build on the new decision tracking logic.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for advanced task engine and decision tracking
- Add integration tests for context switching in workspaces
- Manual QA: Verify adaptive task prioritization, decision logging, and workspace context adaptation
