# Data Modeling: Comprehensive Logging System

## Overview

This document describes how logged data is processed, transformed, and used for model training while maintaining privacy. It outlines the data structures, processing pipelines, and modeling approaches utilized by the Comprehensive Logging System.

## Data Collection & Structure

### Data Categories

The system collects the following categories of data:

1. **User Interactions**: UI events, navigation patterns, feature usage
2. **Service Operations**: API calls, function execution, performance metrics
3. **AI Interactions**: Prompts, responses, feedback loops
4. **System Events**: Errors, warnings, diagnostics
5. **Business Events**: Task creation, idea generation, company activities

### Log Structure

Logs are stored with a consistent schema:

```typescript
interface LogEvent {
  id: string;
  user_id?: string;
  persona_id?: string;
  company_id?: string;
  event_type: string;
  event_source: string;
  component?: string;
  action: string;
  data: any; // JSONB in database
  metadata?: any; // JSONB in database
  data_classification: 'non_personal' | 'pseudonymized' | 'personal' | 'sensitive';
  retention_policy: 'transient' | 'short_term' | 'medium_term' | 'long_term';
  session_id?: string;
  client_info?: any;
  created_at: string;
}
```

### Data Relationships

The system maintains relationships between:

- Users and their actions
- Companies and their members
- Sessions and events
- Related actions within workflows

These relationships allow for contextual understanding of the data when used in model training.

## Data Processing Pipelines

### 1. Privacy Transformation Pipeline

Before data can be used for model training, it passes through privacy transformations:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Raw Logs] --> B[Consent Filtering]
    B --> C[Classification]
    C --> D[Privacy Transform]
    D -->|Non-personal| E[Aggregation]
    D -->|Pseudonymized| F[ID Replacement]
    D -->|Personal| G[Anonymization]
    D -->|Sensitive| H[Exclusion]
    E --> I[Training-Ready Data]
    F --> I
    G --> I
```

#### Privacy Transformation Steps

1. **Consent Filtering**: Exclude data for users who haven't consented to relevant processing
2. **Classification**: Apply automatic classification to identify data sensitivity
3. **Privacy Transform**: Apply appropriate transformation based on classification level
4. **Aggregation/Anonymization**: Remove identifiers while preserving patterns

### 2. Feature Extraction Pipeline

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Privacy-Processed Logs] --> B[Temporal Grouping]
    B --> C[Pattern Recognition]
    C --> D[Feature Extraction]
    D --> E[Feature Vectorization]
    E --> F[Feature Storage]
    F --> G[Model Training Pipeline]
```

#### Feature Extraction Steps

1. **Temporal Grouping**: Organize data by time windows (sessions, days, weeks)
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring patterns and sequences
3. **Feature Extraction**: Transform raw data into meaningful features
4. **Vectorization**: Convert features to numerical representations for models

### 3. Model Training Pipeline

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Feature Vectors] --> B[Dataset Creation]
    B --> C[Dataset Splitting]
    C --> D[Training]
    C --> E[Validation]
    C --> F[Testing]
    D --> G[Model Evaluation]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H[Model Registration]
    H --> I[Deployment]
```

## Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Techniques

The system implements several privacy-preserving techniques in its modeling:

### Differential Privacy

Applied to aggregate statistics to ensure individual users cannot be identified from results:

```typescript
function addDifferentialPrivacy(statistic: number, sensitivity: number, epsilon: number): number {
  // Add calibrated noise to protect privacy while maintaining statistical utility
  const scale = sensitivity / epsilon;
  const noise = laplacianNoise(scale);
  return statistic + noise;
}
```

### Federated Learning

Where appropriate, models are trained across distributed data without centralizing raw data:

1. Initial model is distributed to client instances
2. Local updates occur on client data
3. Model gradients (not data) are sent back to central system
4. Gradients are aggregated to improve the shared model

### K-Anonymity Enforcement

Ensures that any pattern in the data applies to at least k different users:

```typescript
function enforceKAnonymity(dataset: any[], k: number): any[] {
  // Group by quasi-identifiers
  const groups = groupByQuasiIdentifiers(dataset);
  
  // Filter out groups with fewer than k records
  return groups.filter(group => group.length >= k)
    .flatMap(group => group);
}
```

### Secure Multi-Party Computation

For sensitive operations across organizational boundaries:

1. Computation is split into multiple shares
2. Each party computes on encrypted shares
3. Results are combined without revealing inputs

## Model Evaluation & Improvement

Models are evaluated using:

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Accuracy, precision, recall for classification
   - RMSE, MAE for prediction

   - Membership inference resistance
   - Model inversion resistance

3. **Business Impact Metrics**:
   - User engagement lift
   - Task completion improvements

### Feedback Loops

Models improve through several feedback mechanisms:

1. **Explicit Feedback**: User ratings and surveys
2. **Implicit Feedback**: Engagement with recommendations
3. **A/B Testing**: Controlled experiments
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous evaluation

### Retraining Strategy

Models are retrained based on:

1. **Schedule-based**: Regular interval retraining
2. **Drift-based**: When input distribution changes
3. **Performance-based**: When metrics degrade
4. **Feature-based**: When new features are added

## Data Retention for Models

### Training Data Lifecycle

1. **Raw Data**: Retained according to classification-based retention policies
2. **Feature Vectors**: Retained with pseudonymized IDs
