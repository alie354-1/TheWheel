## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1 Backend Developer
- 1 Frontend Developer
- 1 UI/UX Designer (part-time)
- 1 QA Engineer (part-time)

### Infrastructure
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Database capacity for new tables
- Increased OpenAI API quota for additional prompts

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| OpenAI API response format changes | High | Medium | Implement robust parsing with fallbacks |
| Performance issues with large datasets | Medium | Medium | Implement pagination and lazy loading |
| User confusion with multi-step workflow | Medium | Low | Create intuitive UI and clear instructions |
| JSON parsing errors from AI responses | High | High | Implement fallback mechanisms and error handling |
| Integration issues with existing components | Medium | Medium | Thorough testing and clear component interfaces |

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- 80%+ test coverage
- < 2 second response time for idea generation
- < 2 second response time for idea merging
- Zero critical bugs in production

### User Metrics
- 70%+ of users complete the full pathway
- 50%+ of users try the merging functionality
- Positive user feedback (> 4/5 rating)

## Post-Implementation Evaluation

After deployment, conduct an evaluation to assess:
1. Feature adoption rate
2. User satisfaction
3. Performance in production
4. Areas for improvement

Schedule a retrospective two weeks after deployment to collect insights and plan future enhancements.
