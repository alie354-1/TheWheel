you # Hugging Face Spaces Integration Fix

## Problem Diagnosis

We've identified the following issues with your Hugging Face Spaces integration:

1. **Space URL Format**: The URL format appears to be correct, but the Space is returning errors.
2. **Authentication Required**: Your Space at https://huggingface.co/spaces/alie354/company-base-expert-model is private (we received a 401 Unauthorized error), which means you need to provide an authentication token.
3. **API Endpoint**: The endpoint is correctly set to `/api/predict` but the Space is not responding to this endpoint.

## Solution

We've created several tools to help you fix these issues:

### 1. Add Authentication Token

Since your Space is private, you need to add a Hugging Face authentication token to access it:

```bash
node scripts/add-huggingface-auth-token.cjs YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` with your actual Hugging Face token. You can get a token from the [Hugging Face settings page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

### 2. Test Different API Endpoints

If adding the authentication token doesn't solve the issue, your Space might be using a different API endpoint. Run the following script to test various endpoints:

```bash
node scripts/test-huggingface-spaces-connection.js
```

This script will try different common API endpoints and report which ones work.

### 3. Update API Endpoint

If the test script finds a working endpoint that's different from the current one, you can update it with:

```bash
node scripts/run-huggingface-fix.cjs
```

## Troubleshooting Steps

If you're still experiencing issues, here are some steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Verify Space Status**: Make sure your Space is running by visiting it in your browser at https://huggingface.co/spaces/alie354/company-base-expert-model. If it shows "This Space is currently paused", click the "Restart Space" button.

2. **Check Space API Documentation**: Your Space may have custom API endpoints. Check the documentation or source code of your Space to find the correct endpoint.

3. **Test Direct API Connection**: Use curl to directly test your Space API:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://alie354-company-base-expert-model.hf.space/api/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"inputs": "Test query"}'
```

4. **Check the Space Implementation**: Your Space might be implemented with:
   - Gradio (common endpoints: `/api/predict`, `/run/predict`)
   - FastAPI (common endpoints: `/predict`, `/generate`)
   - Custom implementation with other endpoints

5. **Verify Input Format**: Different Spaces expect different input formats:
   - Standard: `{"inputs": "Your query", "parameters": {...}}`
   - Data array: `{"data": ["Your query"]}`
