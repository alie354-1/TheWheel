# Dashboard Loading Fix

The dashboard was failing to load properly due to several interdependent issues with component loading, error handling, and suspense fallback states.

## Fixes Implemented

1. Comprehensive error boundary implementation around all dashboard components
2. Proper React.Suspense usage for lazy-loaded components
3. Enhanced error recovery and fallback UI states
4. Improved loading indicators and user feedback
5. Better error isolation to prevent cascading failures

## How to Test the Fix

You can verify the dashboard is loading correctly by:

1. Running the application with `npm run dev`
2. Navigating to the dashboard page `/dashboard`
3. Running the test script by pasting this in the browser console:

```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = '/scripts/test-dashboard-load.js';
document.body.appendChild(script);
```

4. Check the console output - you should see "âœ… SUCCESS: Dashboard loaded properly"
