## Technical Tasks

- Conduct final QA, bug fixing, and UI/UX polish across all modules
- Finalize and publish user, admin, and developer documentation
- Implement and configure monitoring, alerting, and support tools for post-launch
- Build/extend team performance and knowledge analytics dashboards
- Add/extend unit, integration, and E2E tests for all critical paths
- Prepare release notes and launch checklist

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in appropriate subfolders for analytics, documentation, monitoring, and support
- Extend and polish all systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing analytics and reporting infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new analytics, documentation, or monitoring components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the support or alerting logic; build on the new monitoring and support systems.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit, integration, and E2E tests for all modules
- Manual QA: Verify platform polish, documentation, and launch readiness
- Post-launch: Monitor health, collect feedback, and address issues rapidly
