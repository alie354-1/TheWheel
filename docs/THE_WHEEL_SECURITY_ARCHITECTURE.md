# THE WHEEL: SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security architecture for The Wheel platform. Security is a foundational pillar of the platform, ensuring data protection, privacy, compliance, and trust for all users. The security architecture addresses authentication, authorization, data protection, network security, and compliance requirements.

---

## Security Principles

The Wheel's security architecture follows these core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls to protect against various attack vectors
2. **Least Privilege**: Users and systems have only the minimum permissions necessary
3. **Zero Trust**: Verification required for all users and systems, regardless of location
4. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy controls embedded in all aspects of the platform
5. **Secure by Default**: Security enabled out-of-the-box with secure default configurations
6. **Continuous Verification**: Ongoing testing, monitoring, and verification of security controls

## Authentication System

### Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

- Email/password authentication with strong password policies
- Optional MFA via authenticator apps (TOTP)
- SMS verification as a fallback when enabled
- WebAuthn support for biometric and hardware security keys
- Social authentication with secure OAuth 2.0 integrations

### Session Management

- JWT-based authentication with proper signature validation
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days) with secure rotation
- Secure cookie storage with HttpOnly and SameSite flags
- Automatic session termination after inactivity

### Account Security

- Secure account recovery workflows
- Rate limiting on authentication attempts
- Real-time notifications of suspicious login attempts
- Device management and active session visibility
- Progressive security measures based on risk assessment

---

## Authorization Framework

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Platform-level roles (Admin, User, Guest)
- Company-level roles (Owner, Admin, Member)
- Mode-specific permissions (Founder, Advisor, Investor)
- Fine-grained permission inheritance hierarchy
- Attribute-based access control for complex scenarios

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

- Database-enforced security policies
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Mode-aware data visibility rules
- History-based access for previous collaborations
- Time-bound access controls for temporary permissions

### API Security

- Consistent authorization checks across all endpoints
- Scoped API tokens with limited permissions
- CORS policies to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests
- Content Security Policy implementation
- API rate limiting and abuse prevention

---

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

| Classification | Description | Examples | Controls |
|----------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Public | Information intended for public consumption | Marketing materials, public documentation | Integrity checks |
| Internal | Information for authenticated users | Knowledge Hub resources, Community content | Authentication required |
| Confidential | Sensitive business information | Financial data, strategic plans | Role-based access, encryption |
| Restricted | Highly sensitive information | Payment details, authentication credentials | End-to-end encryption, strict access |

### Encryption Strategy
