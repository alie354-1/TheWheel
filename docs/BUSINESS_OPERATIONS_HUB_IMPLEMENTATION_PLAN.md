## Epics & User Stories

### Epic 1: Business Domain Dashboard

**Goal**: Create a unified dashboard that organizes the business journey by functional domains, providing clear status visualizations and actionable insights.

#### User Stories:

##### Story 1.1: Business Domain Taxonomy Creation

**As a** product manager,  
**When I** define the business domain taxonomy,  
**I want to** create a comprehensive set of business domains that map to existing journey content,  
**So I can** organize the journey experience around functional business areas rather than abstract steps.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am in the domain administration interface
When I create a new business domain with name, description, and icon
Then the domain is saved in the database
And appears in the domain management console

Given a business domain exists in the system
When I update its attributes (name, description, icon, color)
Then all changes are reflected immediately in the database
And the change is visible in the domain management console

Given a set of business domains exists
When I modify the sequence by dragging to reorder
Then the new order is saved to the database
And is maintained when reopening the management console
```

**Notes:**
- Initial domain taxonomy should include at minimum: Marketing, Sales, Product Development, Operations, Finance, Legal/Compliance, and Team/HR
- Each domain should have a unique identifying color and icon
- Consider using industry-standard iconography for domain recognition
- The domain taxonomy should be extensible for future additions
- Domain sequence should be customizable at both system and user level

##### Story 1.2: Journey-to-Domain Mapping

**As a** content manager,  
**When I** review existing journey steps and challenges,  
**I want to** map them to appropriate business domains,  
**So I can** ensure all valuable content is properly categorized in the new system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am in the mapping administration tool
When I select a journey step or challenge
Then I see a list of potential business domains to map it to
And can assign primary and secondary domain associations

Given a journey step is displayed in the mapping tool
When I search for specific domains
Then relevant domains filter to the top of the selection list
And I can quickly assign the most appropriate domain

Given a journey step has been mapped to a business domain
When I view analytics for the mapping
Then I see relevance scores and confidence metrics
And can adjust the mapping if the score is below threshold
```

**Notes:**
- Each journey step can have one primary domain and multiple secondary domains
- Relevance scores should be calculated based on content analysis and past user behavior
- Bulk mapping tools should be available for efficient processing
- Consider implementing AI assistance for initial mapping suggestions
- Create an audit log of all mapping decisions for quality review

##### Story 1.3: Business Domain Dashboard Layout

**As a** founder,  
**When I** access my journey experience,  
**I want to** see a clear business-oriented dashboard of domains,  
**So I can** quickly understand my business status and focus on the right areas.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am logged into my account
When I navigate to the main journey page
Then I see a dashboard organized by business domains
And each domain is represented by a distinct visual card

Given the domain dashboard is displayed
When I view it on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
Then the layout adapts responsively
And all domains remain accessible and readable

Given I am viewing the domain dashboard
When I focus on a specific domain card
Then I see a subtle visual emphasis
And can easily navigate to detailed domain view with a single click
```

**Notes:**
- Dashboard should use a grid layout that reorganizes based on screen size
- Domain cards should have consistent height but can have variable width
- Consider using masonry-style layouts for efficient space utilization
- Each domain should maintain its brand color and icon for recognition
- Animation should be subtle and purposeful, not distracting
- Dashboard should load quickly, with appropriate skeleton states during data fetching

##### Story 1.4: Domain Status Visualization

**As a** founder,  
**When I** look at a business domain on my dashboard,  
**I want to** see clear visual indicators of domain health and progress,  
**So I can** quickly identify areas that need attention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a business domain has associated tasks
When I view its domain card
Then I see a visual progress indicator showing completion percentage
And the indicator uses color to convey status (on track, needs attention, at risk)

Given a domain has recent activity
When I view its domain card
Then I see indicators showing recent changes or updates
And can distinguish between my actions and system updates

Given a domain has critical issues or opportunities
When I view its domain card
Then I see prominent alert indicators
And can quickly identify what requires immediate attention
```

**Notes:**
- Status visualization should be accessible and not rely solely on color
- Consider using multiple indicators for different aspects (progress, activity, attention needed)
- Implement tooltips to provide context for all status indicators
- Status should be calculated using configurable business rules
- System should refresh status at appropriate intervals or triggered by events
- Consider adding subtle animations for status changes to draw attention

##### Story 1.5: Priority Task Preview

**As a** founder,  
**When I** look at a business domain card,  
**I want to** see the highest priority tasks for that domain,  
**So I can** quickly understand what needs attention without drilling down.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a business domain has associated tasks
When I view its domain card
Then I see up to 3 highest priority tasks
And each task shows a clear title and status indicator

Given a task appears in the priority preview
When I hover over the task
Then I see a tooltip with additional context
And an indication of why this task is prioritized

Given a task appears in the priority preview
When I click on the task
Then I am taken directly to that task detail view
And the context is preserved during navigation
```

**Notes:**
- Priority calculation should use the existing recommendation system with domain context
- Tasks should display concise, action-oriented titles in the preview
- Consider showing estimated time to complete for each task
- Include subtle visual cues to indicate task dependencies or blockers
- Priority preview should update automatically when tasks are completed
- Consider letting users pin specific tasks to override the priority algorithm

##### Story 1.6: Domain Customization Interface

**As a** founder,  
**When I** set up my Business Operations Hub,  
**I want to** customize which domains appear and in what order,  
**So I can** focus on the areas most relevant to my business.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am viewing the domain dashboard
When I access the customization controls
Then I see options to show/hide domains
And can drag to reorder them

Given I customize my domain dashboard
When I complete the customization
Then my preferences are saved
And persist across sessions and devices

Given I have hidden a domain
When that domain has critical updates or high-priority tasks
Then I receive a notification
And am given the option to unhide the domain
```

**Notes:**
- Customization interface should be intuitive and discoverable
- Include "reset to default" option to restore standard configuration
- Consider offering pre-set configurations based on business type
- Save preferences in real-time as changes are made
- Domain preferences should be shareable with team members
- System should suggest domains based on business profile and activity

##### Story 1.7: Dashboard-to-Detail Navigation

**As a** founder,  
**When I** identify a domain of interest on my dashboard,  
**I want to** easily navigate to a detailed view of that domain,  
**So I can** work on specific tasks and see comprehensive domain information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am viewing the domain dashboard
When I click on a domain card
Then I am taken to a detailed view of that domain
And see all associated tasks and information

Given I navigate to a domain detail view
When I want to return to the dashboard
Then I can use a clear navigation element
And my dashboard state is preserved

Given I am working in a domain detail view
When I need to switch to another domain
Then I can navigate directly without returning to the dashboard
And my context is maintained appropriately
```

**Notes:**
- Navigation should be smooth and animated to maintain context
- Include breadcrumb navigation for clear location awareness
- Consider tab-based navigation between domains in the detail view
- Preserve scroll position and filters when navigating back to the dashboard
- Navigation patterns should be consistent throughout the application
- Consider keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Epic 2: Enhanced Task Management

**Goal**: Transform the existing step/task system into a flexible, prioritized workflow that adapts to user actions while maintaining structured data collection.

#### User Stories:

##### Story 2.1: Unified Task List Implementation

**As a** founder,  
**When I** need to manage my business tasks,  
**I want to** see all tasks across domains in a unified list,  
**So I can** efficiently work through priorities regardless of domain.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am in the task management interface
When I view the task list
Then I see tasks from all business domains
And can identify which domain each task belongs to

Given I am viewing the unified task list
When I apply filters (by domain, status, priority, etc.)
Then the list updates to show only matching tasks
And the filter state is visually indicated

Given tasks exist from multiple domains
When I sort the task list by different criteria
Then tasks reorder appropriately
And the sort direction is clearly indicated
```

**Notes:**
- Task list should support both list and grid viewing options
- Each task should show domain affiliation through color coding or icons
- Include virtual scrolling for performance with large task lists
- Filters should be combinable (e.g., high priority Finance tasks)
- Consider implementing saved filter sets for frequent use cases
- Use subtle animations for list updates to maintain context

##### Story 2.2: Quick Task Status Actions

**As a** founder,  
**When I** need to update the status of tasks,  
**I want to** use quick single-click actions,  
**So I can** efficiently manage my task list without complex workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am viewing a task in the list
When I click the "complete" action
Then the task status updates immediately
And I receive visual confirmation of the change

Given I am viewing a task in the list
When I click the "not applicable" action
Then I am prompted to optionally provide a reason
And the task is appropriately flagged and deprioritized

Given I have multiple tasks selected
When I use a bulk status update action
Then all selected tasks update to the new status
And I receive a summary confirmation of the changes
```

**Notes:**
- Quick actions should be accessible via both mouse and keyboard shortcuts
- Include hover states to preview actions before clicking
- Status changes should trigger appropriate event logging for learning
- Consider implementing undo functionality for accidental status changes
- Status updates should sync in real-time across devices
- Visual feedback should be clear but not disruptive

##### Story 2.3: Custom Task Creation

**As a** founder,  
**When I** identify work needed that isn't in the system,  
**I want to** create custom tasks within any business domain,  
**So I can** track all my work in one system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am in the task management interface
When I activate the "Create Task" function
Then I can enter task details including title, description, and domain
And set optional fields like priority, due date, and dependencies

Given I am creating a new task
When I select a business domain
Then I see appropriate task templates for that domain
And can use them to quickly create standardized tasks

Given I have created a custom task
When I view my task list
Then my custom task appears alongside system-recommended tasks
And is treated equally in filtering and sorting
```

**Notes:**
- Custom task creation should be available throughout the interface
- Quick-create option with minimal required fields for efficiency
- Advanced creation with full options for detailed task definition
- Support for recurring task creation with frequency settings
- Consider "duplicate task" function for similar task creation
- Custom tasks should be shareable with team members

##### Story 2.4: Task Reordering Capabilities

**As a** founder,  
**When I** plan my workflow,  
**I want to** reorder tasks via drag and drop,  
**So I can** organize my work in a sequence that makes sense for my situation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am viewing the task list
When I drag a task to a new position
Then the task moves to that position
And the new order is saved

Given I have customized my task order
When I return to the task list later
Then my custom ordering is preserved
And is reflected across all my devices

Given I am viewing a custom-ordered task list
When I apply a new sort or filter
Then I am prompted whether to preserve my custom ordering
And can choose to maintain or override it
```

**Notes:**
- Drag handle should be clearly indicated and accessible
- Provide visual feedback during the drag operation (shadow, highlight, etc.)
- Consider allowing reordering across domain boundaries
- Save order changes immediately without requiring explicit save action
- Implement keyboard accessibility for reordering (e.g., Alt+arrow keys)
- Custom ordering should be able to coexist with priority indicators

##### Story 2.5: Task Dependency Visualization

**As a** founder,  
**When I** view my tasks,  
**I want to** see clear indicators of dependencies between tasks,  
**So I can** understand what work needs to be completed first to unlock future opportunities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given tasks have dependency relationships
When I view the task list
Then I see visual indicators showing which tasks are dependent on others
And which tasks are blocking other work

Given a task has dependencies
When I hover over the dependency indicator
Then I see a tooltip showing the specific dependent tasks
And can navigate directly to those tasks

Given I am viewing a task with dependencies
When I attempt to mark it as complete
Then I receive appropriate warnings if completing it will affect other tasks
And can see the potential impact before confirming
```

**Notes:**
- Use directional indicators to show dependency flow
- Consider color coding to distinguish blockers from enablers
- Implement a dependency graph view for complex dependency networks
- Include visual differentiation for hard dependencies vs. recommendations
- Allow manual creation and editing of dependencies
- Consider automated dependency suggestions based on task content

### Epic 3: Contextual Workspace System

**Goal**: Create environment-specific workspaces that combine planning, resources, and execution for different business domains and activities.

#### User Stories:

##### Story 3.1: Workspace Container Component

**As a** founder,  
**When I** need to work on tasks within a specific business domain,  
**I want to** have a dedicated workspace with all relevant resources and tools,  
**So I can** complete my work efficiently without context switching.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I select a business domain
When I enter its workspace
Then I see a consistent container layout
And all domain-specific content, tools, and resources are available

Given I am in a domain workspace
When I resize my browser window
Then the workspace adapts responsively
And maintains usability across device sizes

Given I have multiple workspaces open
When I switch between them
Then each workspace maintains its state
And I can resume work without loss of context
```

**Notes:**
- Workspace should have consistent header, body, and footer regions
- Include a customizable sidebar for frequently used tools and resources
- Design for smooth transitions between workspace sections
- Implement lazy loading for performance optimization
- Consider tabbed interfaces for related workspace sections
- Workspace should remember scroll position, active tabs, and expanded sections

##### Story 3.2: Context Detection System

**As a** founder,  
**When I** work on different types of tasks,  
**I want to** see information and tools relevant to my current activity,  
**So I can** focus on the task at hand without distractions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am working on a specific task
When the system detects my work context
Then it presents relevant resources and tools
And minimizes unrelated information

Given I switch between different types of tasks
When the context changes
Then the interface adapts smoothly
And prioritizes newly relevant information

Given the system has detected my context
When that detection is incorrect
Then I can manually override the context
And the system learns from this correction
```

**Notes:**
- Context detection should use multiple signals (active task, recent activity, explicit selection)
- Transitions between contexts should be smooth and non-disruptive
- System should recognize common context patterns (planning, implementation, review)
- Include context history to support going back to previous contexts
- Consider implementing confidence scores for context detection
- Allow users to explicitly set context when automatic detection is insufficient

##### Story 3.3: Dynamic Content Presentation

**As a** founder,  
**When I** am working in a specific context,  
**I want to** see information presented with appropriate detail levels,  
**So I can** access what I need without being overwhelmed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am in a specific workspace context
When content is loaded
Then it is presented with appropriate detail level for my context
And I can expand or collapse sections as needed

Given different types of information are available
When they are presented in the workspace
Then they follow a consistent information hierarchy
And the most relevant information is most prominent

Given I have previously used the workspace
When I return to a similar context
Then my preferred information display settings are remembered
And applied automatically
```

**Notes:**
- Implement progressive disclosure patterns for complex information
- Use consistent expand/collapse controls across the interface
- Consider using cards, tabs, and accordions for organizational clarity
- Information density should adapt to screen size and user preferences
- Include preview capabilities for referenced content
- Consider implementing focus mode to highlight active content section

##### Story 3.4: Workspace Sharing Functionality

**As a** founder,  
**When I** configure a useful workspace layout,  
**I want to** share it with my team members,  
**So we can** collaborate efficiently with consistent views.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I have customized a workspace
When I use the share function
Then I can select team members to share with
And specify whether to share as a copy or live-linked version

Given a workspace has been shared with me
When I accept the shared workspace
Then it appears in my workspace collection
And I can use it with all its configurations

Given I am using a shared workspace
When the original creator updates it (if live-linked)
Then I receive notification of the changes
And can choose to accept or keep my version
```

**Notes:**
- Include options for sharing with individuals or the whole team
- Consider permission levels (view-only, edit, etc.)
- Implement diffing to show changes between workspace versions
- Include commenting functionality for collaborative refinement
- Create activity feeds to show recent changes to shared workspaces
- Consider template functionality for organizationally approved workspaces

##### Story 3.5: Work Mode Toggling

**As a** founder,  
**When I** switch between different types of work activities,  
**I want to** toggle between specialized interface modes,  
**So I can** have the optimal environment for each type of work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am in a workspace
When I select a different work mode (planning, execution, review)
Then the interface adapts to support that mode
And provides appropriate tools and layouts

Given I switch to planning mode
When I view the workspace
Then I see big-picture information and strategic tools
And the interface supports brainstorming and organization

Given I switch to execution mode
When I view the workspace
Then I see detailed task information and action-oriented tools
And the interface supports efficient task completion
```

**Notes:**
- Design distinct visual indicators for different modes
- Consider using color themes to reinforce mode differences
- Transition animations should help orient users during mode switches
- Preserve common elements across modes for consistency
- Save mode preferences per domain/workspace
- Consider automatic mode suggestions based on task type and user behavior

### Epic 4: Tool Integration

**Goal**: Seamlessly integrate tool discovery, evaluation, and implementation directly into business workflows.

#### User Stories:

##### Story 4.1: Contextual Tool Recommendation

**As a** founder,  
**When I** work on a specific business task,  
**I want to** see tools recommended in context that could help me complete the task,  
**So I can** discover relevant solutions without interrupting my workflow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am working on a specific task
When the system identifies relevant tools
Then tool recommendations appear in context
And include a clear explanation of why each tool is suggested

Given a tool is recommended
When I view the recommendation
Then I see a relevance score and confidence indicator
And understand how the tool relates to my current work

Given multiple tools are recommended
When I view them in context
Then they are ordered by relevance
And I can easily compare basic features without leaving my workflow
```

**Notes:**
- Tool recommendations should be visually distinct but not intrusive
- Include dismiss and "don't show again" options for unwanted recommendations
- Recommendations should consider business context, task type, and user history
- Provide quick preview capabilities for recommended tools
- Consider implementing "tool of the moment" for especially relevant suggestions
- Track recommendation engagement for system learning

##### Story 4.2: Enhanced Tool Comparison

**As a** founder,  
**When I** need to select between multiple tool options,  
**I want to** see a side-by-side comparison with relevant criteria,  
**So I can** make informed decisions efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I am considering multiple tools
When I activate the comparison view
Then I see tools presented side-by-side
And comparison criteria relevant to my business context

Given tools are displayed in comparison view
When I scroll through the comparison
Then the headers and tool names remain fixed
And I can easily correlate features across tools

Given I am comparing tools
When I want to customize comparison criteria
Then I can add or remove criteria
And the comparison updates dynamically
```

**Notes:**
- Default comparison criteria should be context-sensitive
- Allow hiding/showing of comparison rows for focus

##### Story 5.3: Recommendation Explanation Component

**As a** founder,  
**When I** receive a recommendation,  
**I want to** understand why it was suggested to me,  
**So I can** evaluate its relevance and build trust in the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I view a recommendation
When I check its explanation
Then I see the key factors that led to this recommendation
And understand the relative importance of each factor

Given a recommendation has a confidence score
When I view the explanation
Then I understand what the confidence score means
And what factors might increase or decrease confidence

Given I disagree with a recommendation
When I access the explanation
Then I can identify which assumptions were incorrect
And provide feedback to improve future recommendations
```

**Notes:**
- Explanations should be concise with expandable details
- Use plain language rather than technical terms
- Include both positive factors (why recommended) and limitations
- Consider visual representations of decision factors
- Implement differentiating explanations when similar items are recommended
- Design explanations to build trust and transparency

##### Story 5.4: Dynamic Priority Adjustment

**As a** founder,  
**When** my business situation changes,  
**I want** task priorities to update automatically,  
**So I can** focus on what's most important without manual reprioritization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given new information becomes available about my business
When the priority engine processes this information
Then task priorities update automatically
And I see visual indicators of priority changes

Given a task's priority has changed
When I view my task list
Then I see the updated priority
And can understand the reason for the priority change

Given multiple factors influence task priority
When priorities are calculated
Then the system weighs these factors appropriately
And adapts to my business's specific context
```

**Notes:**
- Priority factors should include: dependencies, time sensitivity, business impact, user preferences
- Create smoothing algorithms to prevent priority thrashing
- Implement priority history to track changes over time
- Consider allowing priority locks for user-defined high-priority items
- Design clear visual language for priority levels and changes
- Priority calculations should run both on schedule and event-triggered

##### Story 5.5: Cohort-Based Pattern Recognition

**As a** founder,  
**When** I use the system,  
**I want to** benefit from patterns observed across similar businesses,  
**So I can** learn from others' experiences while maintaining privacy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given I have a business profile
When the system identifies similar businesses
Then it creates anonymized cohort groupings
And identifies successful patterns within those cohorts

Given pattern data exists from similar businesses
When generating recommendations
Then the system incorporates these patterns
And indicates when a suggestion is cohort-derived

Given I take actions that differ from my cohort's patterns
When those actions lead to positive outcomes
Then the system learns from these exceptions
And refines cohort definitions and pattern recognition
```

**Notes:**
- Implement strict privacy protections for cohort analysis
- Design cohort formation using multiple factors (size, industry, stage, goals)
- Create dynamically updating cohorts rather than static groups
- Consider confidence indicators for pattern strength
- Build mechanisms to prevent codifying biases or perpetuating unsuccessful approaches
