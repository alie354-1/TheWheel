# AI Task Generation

## Overview

The AI Task Generation system is an intelligent feature that automatically suggests relevant tasks based on user input, standup entries, and project context. It helps users break down their work into actionable items, prioritize effectively, and stay focused on high-impact activities.

## Features

### 1. Context-Aware Task Suggestions

The system generates tasks that are specifically tailored to:

- The user's current work (from standup entries)
- Previous tasks and progress
- Project stage and goals
- Identified blockers and challenges

### 2. Comprehensive Task Details

Each AI-generated task includes:

- **Title**: Clear, action-oriented description
- **Description**: Concise explanation of the task
- **Priority**: High, medium, or low importance
- **Estimated Hours**: Time prediction for completion
- **Task Type**: Categorization (Research, Planning, Development, etc.)
- **Implementation Tips**: Practical advice for effective execution
- **Potential Challenges**: Anticipated obstacles to be aware of
- **Success Metrics**: Clear indicators for measuring completion
- **Resources**: Relevant links, tools, and references
- **Learning Resources**: Educational materials related to the task
- **Tools**: Suggested software or platforms to use

### 3. Integration with Workflow

Tasks can be:

- Generated from standup entries
- Added to task lists
- Tracked through completion
- Updated with progress
- Filtered and sorted by various criteria

## AI Implementation

### Task Generation Process

The AI task generation process follows these steps:

1. **Input Collection**: Gather context from standup entries or direct user input
2. **Context Enrichment**: Add historical data and project information
3. **Prompt Construction**: Create a detailed prompt with specific instructions
4. **AI Processing**: Send the prompt to the language model
5. **Response Parsing**: Extract and validate the structured task data
6. **Fallback Handling**: Provide default tasks if AI generation fails

### Prompt Engineering

The system uses carefully crafted prompts that include:

1. **User Context**: Information from standup entries or direct input
2. **Historical Context**: Previous work and tasks
3. **Output Format**: Specific JSON structure for consistent parsing
4. **Guidance**: Instructions for creating actionable, relevant tasks

Example prompt structure:
```
You are a cofounder suggesting tasks based on your partner's standup:

Accomplished: [accomplished]
Working on: [working_on]
Blockers: [blockers]
Goals: [goals]

[Additional context from previous standups]

Suggest 2 important tasks in JSON format:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Clear action-oriented task title",
    "description": "One concise sentence explaining the task",
    "priority": "high|medium|low",
    "estimated_hours": 2,
    "task_type": "Research|Planning|Development",
    "implementation_tips": ["One practical tip for effective implementation"],
    "potential_challenges": ["One specific challenge to be aware of"],
    "success_metrics": ["One clear way to measure success"],
    "resources": []
  }
]
```

Be clear and direct but maintain a supportive tone. Focus on tasks that will have the most impact while being realistic about what can be accomplished.
```

### AI Architecture

The task generation system leverages multiple components:

1. **AITaskGenerator Component**: React component that provides the UI for generating tasks
2. **StandupAIService**: Service that handles the core AI logic for task generation
3. **GeneralLLMService**: Underlying service for language model communication
4. **Task Service**: Manages task persistence and retrieval

### Error Handling and Fallbacks

The system includes robust error handling:

1. **JSON Parsing**: Gracefully handles malformed AI responses
2. **Validation**: Ensures all task fields meet expected formats
3. **Fallback Tasks**: Provides sensible default tasks if generation fails
4. **Error Messaging**: Clear user feedback when issues occur

## Technical Implementation

### Components

1. **AITaskGenerator**: React component that provides the UI for task generation
   - Handles user interaction
   - Manages loading states
   - Displays error messages
   - Passes generated tasks to parent components

2. **Task Management Components**:
   - TaskList: Displays and manages tasks
   - TaskItem: Renders individual task details
   - TaskForm: Allows manual task creation and editing

### Services

1. **StandupAIService**: Core service for AI task generation
   - `generateTasks()`: Creates tasks based on standup entries
   - Handles prompt creation and response parsing
   - Manages fallback logic

2. **Task Service**: Manages task data
   - CRUD operations for tasks
   - Filtering and sorting
   - Persistence to database

### Data Model

The Task data model includes:

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
  category: string;
  task_type: string;
  estimated_hours: number;
  due_date: string;
  ai_suggestions?: {
    implementation_tips: string[];
    potential_challenges: string[];
    success_metrics: string[];
    resources?: any[];
    learning_resources?: any[];
    tools?: any[];
  };
}
```

## Integration with Other Features

The task generation system integrates with:

1. **Standup Bot**: Tasks can be generated directly from standup entries
2. **Project Management**: Tasks can be organized into projects and milestones
3. **User Dashboard**: Tasks appear in user dashboards and activity feeds
4. **Notifications**: Reminders for upcoming or overdue tasks

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the task generation system include:

1. **Task Dependencies**: Define relationships between tasks
2. **Team Assignment**: Suggest task assignments across team members
3. **Time Tracking**: Monitor actual vs. estimated time
4. **Progress Analytics**: Visualize task completion patterns
5. **Integration with External Tools**: Connect with Jira, Asana, Trello, etc.
6. **Custom Task Templates**: User-defined templates for common task types
7. **Voice-to-Task**: Create tasks through voice commands
