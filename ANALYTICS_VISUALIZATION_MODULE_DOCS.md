# Analytics & Visualization Module: Detailed Technical Documentation

---

## 1. Overall Purpose & Architecture

The Analytics & Visualization module is responsible for providing data insights, reporting capabilities, and visual representations of data within The Wheel platform. This includes dashboards, various chart types, interactive maps, and tools for exploring user, company, and system-level analytics. The architecture likely involves components for fetching, processing, and rendering data from multiple sources, potentially leveraging dedicated analytics services and visualization libraries.

## 2. Key Directories and Their Roles

*   **`src/components/analytics/`**: Central directory for core analytics components.
    *   `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`: A primary component for displaying a collection of analytics widgets or panels.
    *   `PredictiveInsightsPanel.tsx`: A panel dedicated to showing predictive analytics or forecasts.
    *   `MultiDimensionalReporting.tsx`: Component for creating and viewing reports with multiple dimensions and filters.
    *   `VisualizationToolkit.tsx`: Potentially a wrapper or provider for a charting library or custom visualization components.
    *   `exportUtils.ts`: Utility functions for exporting analytics data (e.g., to CSV, PDF).
    *   `dashboard/`: Subdirectory for specific dashboard-related analytics components.
        *   `PredictiveInsightsPanel.tsx` (also listed above, might be a re-export or specific instance)
        *   `MultiDimensionalReporting.tsx` (also listed above)
    *   **Note:** Some components like `PredictiveInsightsPanel` and `MultiDimensionalReporting` appear in both the root of `analytics/` and `analytics/dashboard/`. This could indicate re-exports, different versions, or a need for structural cleanup.

## 3. File-by-File Breakdown (Key Components)

*   **`src/components/analytics/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** Serves as a container or main view for displaying various analytics charts, reports, and insights.
    *   **Functionality:** Fetches data via analytics services, configures, and renders different analytics panels or widgets (e.g., `PredictiveInsightsPanel`, `MultiDimensionalReporting`). May include date range selectors or global filters.
    *   **Key Props/State/Context:** Manages layout, data for child components, and potentially user-configurable dashboard settings.
    *   **Relationships:** Hosted on `AnalyticsPage.tsx`. Consumes data from various analytics services. Renders components like `PredictiveInsightsPanel.tsx`.

*   **`src/components/visualization/InteractiveJourneyMap.tsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides an interactive visual representation of a user's or company's journey, showing phases, steps, progress, and potentially tool usage.
    *   **Functionality:** Likely uses a mapping or graphing library (e.g., D3.js, VisX, or a custom solution) to render nodes and edges. Allows user interaction like zooming, panning, clicking on steps for details.
    *   **Key Props/State/Context:** Receives journey data (phases, steps, connections, statuses) as props. Manages internal state for user interactions and display options.
    *   **Relationships:** Used in `JourneyMapView.tsx` on company dashboards and potentially other journey visualization contexts.

*   **`src/components/company/journey/Analytics/JourneyAnalyticsDashboard.tsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** A specialized dashboard focusing on analytics related to the "Journey" feature (e.g., step completion rates, time spent per phase, tool effectiveness within steps).
    *   **Functionality:** Similar to the general `AnalyticsDashboard` but tailored to journey-specific metrics and visualizations.
    *   **Relationships:** Consumes data from `journeyAnalytics.service.ts`.

*   **`src/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** The main application page for users to access and view analytics.
    *   **Functionality:** Renders the `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` and provides the overall page layout and context for analytics features.
    *   **Relationships:** A route target in the application's navigation.

## 4. State Management

*   **Data Fetching & Server State:** Analytics data is primarily fetched from the backend. Libraries like React Query or SWR are highly recommended here (if not already in use) to manage caching, refetching, and stale-while-revalidate patterns for analytics data, which can be query-intensive.
*   **UI State:**
    *   Individual chart components might manage local UI state (e.g., hover effects, tooltip visibility).
    *   Dashboard components (`AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`, `JourneyAnalyticsDashboard.tsx`) will manage the state of filters, date ranges, and potentially the layout or selection of visible widgets. This could use React's `useState`/`useReducer` or be part of a URL-based state management strategy for shareable dashboard views.
*   **Global State/Context:** A global analytics context or store slice might be useful if certain analytics summaries or alerts need to be displayed across different parts of the application (e.g., a KPI summary in the main app header).

## 5. User Flows

1.  **Viewing General Analytics:**
    *   User navigates to `AnalyticsPage.tsx`.
    *   `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` loads, fetching data and displaying various reports and visualizations.
    *   User can interact with filters, date ranges, and drill down into specific reports.
2.  **Viewing Journey Analytics:**
    *   User accesses journey analytics, possibly from a company dashboard or a specific journey view.
    *   `JourneyAnalyticsDashboard.tsx` (or similar) displays metrics related to journey progress, step completion, etc.
    *   `InteractiveJourneyMap.tsx` might be used to visualize journey flow and status.
3.  **Viewing Dashboard Widgets:**
    *   Users see analytics widgets embedded in various dashboards (e.g., `CompanyDashboard.tsx`, Business Ops Hub dashboard). These widgets provide at-a-glance insights.
4.  **Exporting Data:**
    *   Users can export report data or chart data using functionality provided by `exportUtils.ts`.

## 6. Known Issues & Recommendations (Analytics & Visualization Module)

1.  **Data Fetching & Performance:** Analytics queries can be heavy.
    *   **Recommendation:** Ensure efficient data fetching strategies. Utilize backend aggregations where possible. Implement robust caching (client-side and potentially server-side). Use pagination and virtualization for large datasets/reports. Consider using a dedicated analytics database or optimized views if performance becomes an issue with the primary Supabase DB.

2.  **Component Duplication/Overlap:**
    *   As noted, `PredictiveInsightsPanel.tsx` and `MultiDimensionalReporting.tsx` appear in multiple locations.
    *   Analytics panels/widgets might be duplicated across different dashboards (general, company, journey, business-ops).
    *   **Recommendation:** Consolidate common analytics UI components into `src/components/analytics/common/` or similar. Create configurable widgets that can be reused across different dashboards with different data sources or configurations.

3.  **Service Layer Consistency:**
    *   Multiple analytics-related services (`analytics.service.ts`, `financialAnalytics.service.ts`, `journeyAnalytics.service.ts`, `dashboardAnalytics.service.ts`).
    *   **Recommendation:** Review these services for overlapping responsibilities. Ensure a clear separation of concerns. A base `analytics.service.ts` could provide common functionalities, with specialized services inheriting or composing it. The duplicated `dashboardAnalytics.service.ts` needs to be resolved.

4.  **Visualization Library:**
    *   **Recommendation:** If not already standardized, choose a primary visualization/charting library (e.g., Recharts, Nivo, Chart.js) and wrap its components or create custom ones using the `VisualizationToolkit.tsx` for consistent styling and API across the application. This promotes maintainability.

5.  **Clarity of `VisualizationToolkit.tsx`:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Document the purpose and usage of `VisualizationToolkit.tsx`. Is it a set of pre-built chart components, a wrapper for a third-party library, or a provider for visualization context?

6.  **Testing:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Test data transformation logic within services and components. For UI, snapshot tests can be useful for visualization components, along with interaction tests for interactive elements like filters and maps. Mocking data services is crucial for testing analytics components in isolation.
