# Onboarding Completion Fix

## Issue

Users who completed the onboarding process before the multi-persona system was implemented are experiencing the following issues:

1. The setup progress percentage is not displaying correctly (shows as incomplete)
2. Clicking "Continue Setup" takes users back to the beginning of onboarding instead of resuming progress
3. The system incorrectly prompts users to complete onboarding again, even though they've already done so

This happens because the multi-persona profile system tracks onboarding progress in a new `onboarding_state` table, but existing users who completed onboarding before this system was implemented don't have records in this table.

## Solution

We've created a script to mark onboarding as complete for existing users. This script:

1. Identifies all users in the system
2. For each user, it:
   - Gets all of their personas
   - Checks if each persona has an `onboarding_state` record
   - If no record exists, creates one marked as complete
   - If a record exists but is not marked complete, updates it to be complete

## How to Use

Run the provided script:

```bash
./scripts/run-onboarding-completion.sh
```

The script will:
1. Process all users in the system
2. Create or update onboarding state records as needed
3. Print detailed logs of its actions
4. Show statistics at the end (users processed, personas updated, etc.)

## What This Fixes

After running this script:

1. The progress bar will correctly show 100% for users who have already completed onboarding
2. The "Continue Setup" button will no longer appear for these users
3. Users won't be prompted to repeat the onboarding process

## Technical Details

The script uses the following approach:

1. It marks the `current_step` as 'completion' (the final step)
2. It sets all previous steps as completed in the `completed_steps` array
3. It sets the `is_complete` flag to true
4. It adds completion metadata to the `form_data` object

This ensures that the `OnboardingProgressCard` component and other parts of the UI correctly recognize that onboarding has been completed.

## When to Run

Run this script once when upgrading to the multi-persona system to ensure a smooth transition for existing users. It's safe to run multiple times - it will only update records that need to be changed and skip those that are already marked complete.
