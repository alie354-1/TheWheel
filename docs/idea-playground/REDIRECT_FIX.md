# Idea Playground Redirect Fix

## Issue

Users were encountering a 404 error when trying to access the `/idea-playground` URL directly. This was happening because the actual route defined in the application is `/idea-hub/playground`, but users were trying to access the shorter URL.

Error message:
```
No routes matched location "/idea-playground"
```

## Solution

We implemented a redirect in the router configuration to automatically redirect users from `/idea-playground` to `/idea-hub/playground`. This ensures that users can access the Idea Playground feature using either URL.

### Implementation Details

The fix was implemented by adding redirect routes in `App.tsx` for both authenticated and unauthenticated users:

1. For unauthenticated users:
```jsx
<Route path="/idea-playground" element={<Navigate to="/idea-hub/playground" replace />} />
```

2. For authenticated users:
```jsx
<Route path="idea-playground" element={<Navigate to="/idea-hub/playground" replace />} />
```

The `replace` prop ensures that the redirect doesn't add a new entry to the browser history stack, making the back button work correctly.

### Testing

A test script was created at `scripts/test-idea-playground-redirect.js` to verify that the redirect works correctly. The script uses Puppeteer to:

1. Navigate to `/idea-playground`
2. Check if the browser is redirected to `/idea-hub/playground`

To run the test:
```bash
node scripts/test-idea-playground-redirect.js
```

## Benefits

- Improves user experience by handling common URL variations
- Prevents 404 errors when users try to access the shorter URL
- Maintains backward compatibility if the URL was shared or bookmarked

## Future Considerations

If more URL aliases are needed in the future, the same pattern can be applied by adding additional redirect routes in the router configuration.
