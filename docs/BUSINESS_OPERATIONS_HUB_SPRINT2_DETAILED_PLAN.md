   - Create API integration tests
   - Implement component integration tests
   - Add end-to-end user flows

3. **BOH-216.3**: Implement automated accessibility testing
   - Add Jest-Axe for automated accessibility checks
   - Implement Lighthouse CI for quality metrics
   - Create visual regression tests

**Acceptance Criteria:**

```gherkin
Scenario: Unit test coverage
Given the Business Operations Hub codebase
When all unit tests are run
Then there should be at least 80% code coverage
And all core business logic should have test cases
And all tests should pass successfully

Scenario: Integration test verification
Given the Business Operations Hub system
When integration tests are run against a test environment
Then all critical user flows should be validated
And API interactions should be verified
And database operations should be confirmed working

Scenario: Accessibility compliance testing
Given the Business Operations Hub interface
When automated accessibility tests are run
Then there should be no accessibility violations
And WCAG 2.1 AA compliance should be verified
And any exceptions should be documented with justification
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for JavaScript/React tests
- Consider Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Implement mocks for external dependencies
- Use test database for integration tests
- Add performance benchmarks to identify regressions

## Risk Management

1. **Technical Risks**
   - **Risk**: Complex UI implementation challenges with drag and drop
     - **Mitigation**: Use established libraries and allocate extra time for testing
   
   - **Risk**: Performance issues with many domains or tasks
     - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination, virtualization, and efficient data fetching

2. **Project Management Risks**
   - **Risk**: Scope creep from UX feedback
     - **Mitigation**: Maintain clear acceptance criteria and manage change requests

   - **Risk**: Accessibility compliance complexity
     - **Mitigation**: Start with accessibility-first approach and plan for dedicated testing time

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Task completion efficiency | 30% improvement | Time tracking before/after |
| User satisfaction | 85%+ satisfaction rating | In-app feedback survey |
| Accessibility compliance | WCAG 2.1 AA | Automated and manual testing |
| Mobile usage | 40% increase | Analytics tracking |
| Dashboard load time | < 1.5 seconds | Performance monitoring |
