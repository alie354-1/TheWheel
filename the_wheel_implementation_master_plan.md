# The Wheel: Implementation Master Plan

This document serves as the master reference for implementing The Wheel MVP with the new database schema. It provides an overview of all key documents and the overall implementation approach.

## Key Documents

1. **`the_wheel_full_schema.sql`**
   - The core database schema with all tables, relationships, and base functionality
   - Includes the RBAC system, user management, company profiles, journey map, idea hub, tasks, etc.

2. **`supabase/migrations/20250427_mvp_enhancements.sql`**
   - Additional database changes to support MVP requirements
   - Focuses on accessibility, logging, and feature enhancements

3. **`the_wheel_mvp_implementation_plan.md`**
   - Detailed phased implementation plan for the MVP
   - Organized into 7 phases with clear dependencies and requirements
   - Includes technical architecture, testing strategy, and deployment approach

4. **`the_wheel_adaptation_plan.md`**
   - Module-by-module plan for adapting existing code to the new schema
   - Preserves working components while implementing new features
   - Includes specific changes needed for each component

5. **`the_wheel_mvp_implementation_summary.md`**
   - High-level overview of the implementation approach
   - Summary of database enhancements
   - Timeline and next steps

## Implementation Philosophy

Our implementation approach is guided by these core principles:

1. **Preserve Working Code**: We will adapt existing, functional components rather than rewriting them. Components that are already working (like the standup bot) will be preserved and only updated to work with the new schema.

2. **Targeted Refactoring**: We will only refactor where there are gaps, bugs, or schema mismatches. This minimizes risk and development time.

3. **Maintain Functionality**: All existing features will continue to work with the new schema. We will ensure backward compatibility where possible.

4. **Enhance for Requirements**: We will add new features and improvements as specified in the MVP requirements, focusing on delivering value quickly.

5. **Cross-Cutting Excellence**: Throughout the implementation, we will ensure:
   - Perfect responsiveness across all device sizes
   - WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging and analytics

## Important Clarifications

- **Single Venture Context**: Each user can be part of only one company (or none), not that each company can only have one user. Companies can have multiple members, but users cannot be members of multiple companies in the MVP.

- **Existing vs. New Components**: The status indicators in the adaptation plan ([âœ“], [+/-], [~], [ ]) reflect the current state of each component and guide our approach to updating or implementing it.

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Database Setup
1. Run the base schema (`the_wheel_full_schema.sql`) in your Supabase instance
2. Apply the enhancements migration (`20250427_mvp_enhancements.sql`)
3. Verify all tables, views, and functions are created correctly

### Step 2: Data Model & Type Updates
1. Create TypeScript interfaces for all new database tables
2. Update existing interfaces to match new schema
3. Create type guards and validation functions
4. Update API response/request types

### Step 3: Service Layer Updates
1. Update authentication service to use new schema
2. Update user/profile service to use new schema
3. Update company service to use new schema
4. Update journey service to use new schema
5. Update idea service to use new schema
6. Update task service to use new schema
7. Update standup service to use new schema
8. Update community service to use new schema
9. Update messaging service to use new schema
10. Update admin services to use new schema

### Step 4: UI Component Updates
1. Update authentication components
2. Update profile components
3. Update company components
4. Update journey map components
5. Update idea hub components
6. Update task management components
7. Update standup components
8. Update community components
9. Update messaging components
10. Update admin components

### Step 5: New Feature Implementation
1. Implement password reset
2. Implement step completion tracking
3. Implement focus areas
4. Implement step feedback
5. Implement action choices
6. Implement tool recommendation
7. Implement custom tool addition
8. Implement AI tool description generation
9. Implement idea status tracking
10. Implement company page

### Step 6: Cross-Cutting Concerns
1. Implement accessibility enhancements
2. Implement responsive design
3. Implement detailed logging

### Step 7: Testing & Deployment
1. Comprehensive testing of all components
2. Performance optimization
3. Deployment to staging environment
4. Final QA and acceptance testing
5. Production deployment

## Module-by-Module Implementation

For each module, follow this process:

1. **Assessment**: Review the current status and gap analysis in the adaptation plan
2. **Data Model**: Update or create the necessary TypeScript interfaces
3. **Services**: Update or implement the required backend services
4. **UI Components**: Update or implement the required UI components
5. **Testing**: Verify the module works correctly with the new schema
6. **Integration**: Ensure the module integrates properly with other modules
