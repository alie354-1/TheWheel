# Business Operations Hub: Sprint 12 Implementation Plan

## Sprint Goal

Polish the executive dashboard, introduce advanced analytics and reporting, and finalize the intelligence and feedback loop for continuous improvement. All work must extend the modular dashboard, analytics, and intelligence systems from previous sprints.

---

## Context

- The executive dashboard and cross-domain intelligence are in place.
- Analytics and reporting are basic and not yet customizable or predictive.
- The feedback loop for learning and continuous improvement is not yet complete.

### Story 12.3: Continuous Improvement & Feedback Loop

**As** a user  
**I want** the system to learn from my feedback and outcomes  
**So that** recommendations and prioritization improve over time

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Feature: Continuous Improvement & Feedback Loop
  Scenario: System learns from feedback
    Given I provide feedback on recommendations or outcomes
    When the system processes my feedback
    Then future recommendations and priorities are adjusted accordingly
```

---

## Technical Tasks

- Extend analytics and reporting services to support custom KPIs, filters, and export
- Integrate predictive analytics algorithms and benchmarking logic
- Build/extend analytics and reporting UI components in the executive dashboard
- Implement the feedback loop for continuous improvement:
  - Capture user feedback on recommendations and outcomes
  - Adjust recommendation and prioritization logic based on feedback
  - Surface learning and improvement history in the UI
- Add/extend unit and integration tests for analytics, reporting, and feedback loop

---

## Implementation Notes

- All new code must be placed in `src/business-ops-hub/components/dashboard/`, `services/`, or appropriate subfolders
- Extend analytics, reporting, and feedback systems from previous sprints; do not duplicate logic
- Use existing data models and reporting infrastructure where possible
- Document all new service methods, context, and UI props

---

## Do Not Duplicate

- Do not create new analytics or reporting components from scratch; extend the existing ones.
- Do not fork the feedback or intelligence system; build on the new feedback loop logic.

---

## Testing

- Add/extend unit tests for analytics, reporting, and feedback loop
- Add integration tests for predictive insights and benchmarking
- Manual QA: Verify analytics, reporting, and continuous improvement features
