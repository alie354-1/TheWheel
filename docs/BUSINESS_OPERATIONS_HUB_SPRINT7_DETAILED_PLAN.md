## User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, Engineering Tasks, and Notes

---

### **Story 1: Advanced Analytics Dashboard**

**User Story:**  
As an operations leader, I want to view advanced analytics on business operations, tool usage, and outcomes, so I can make data-driven decisions and track progress.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can access a dashboard with visualizations (charts, tables) of key metrics (task completion, tool adoption, feedback trends, etc.).
- Analytics are filterable by domain, time period, and cohort.
- Data is updated in near real-time.
- Users can export analytics data (CSV, PDF).

**Engineering Tasks:**
- [ ] Design and implement analytics dashboard UI (charts, tables, filters).
- [ ] Extend backend to aggregate and serve analytics data (new endpoints or extend existing).
- [ ] Integrate analytics dashboard into the main navigation.
- [ ] Implement data export functionality.

**Notes:**
- Use existing analytics foundation and extend as needed.
- Prioritize actionable, high-signal metrics.

### **Story 2: Cohort-Based Benchmarking and Insights**

**User Story:**  
As a founder, I want to see how my company compares to similar companies (cohorts) and receive insights based on cohort patterns, so I can learn from others and identify areas for improvement.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Companies are grouped into cohorts based on profile (industry, size, stage, etc.).
- Users can view benchmarking data (e.g., average completion rates, tool adoption) for their cohort.
- Cohort-based recommendations and insights are surfaced in the UI.
- Users are informed when data is cohort-derived and can opt out.

**Engineering Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement backend logic for cohort formation and benchmarking.
- [ ] Extend analytics endpoints to include cohort data.
- [ ] Add cohort insights and benchmarking UI to analytics dashboard and recommendations.
- [ ] Add opt-out controls for cohort-based personalization.

**Notes:**
- Ensure strict privacy and anonymization for cohort data.
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout.

### **Story 3: Personalized Guidance and Nudges**

**User Story:**  
As a user, I want to receive personalized guidance, nudges, and reminders based on my activity and preferences, so I stay on track and maximize value from the platform.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system sends personalized nudges (e.g., "Complete this task", "Try this tool") based on user activity, analytics, and feedback.
- Users can configure nudge preferences (frequency, channels).
- Nudges are actionable and context-aware.
- Users can dismiss or snooze nudges.

**Engineering Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement backend logic for generating personalized nudges.
- [ ] Add nudge delivery via in-app notifications and email.
- [ ] Build UI for nudge configuration and management.
- [ ] Integrate nudge actions (dismiss, snooze, act).

**Notes:**
- Use analytics and feedback data to drive nudge logic.
- Avoid notification fatigue; allow user control.

### **Story 4: Enhanced Feedback Loop and A/B Testing**

**User Story:**  
As a product manager, I want to run A/B tests on recommendations and features, and collect granular feedback, so we can continuously improve the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system supports A/B testing for recommendations, nudges, and UI features.
- Feedback collection is enhanced with contextual surveys and follow-ups.
- Analytics dashboard includes A/B test results and feedback breakdowns.
- Users are informed when participating in a test.

**Engineering Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement A/B testing framework in backend and frontend.
- [ ] Add contextual feedback prompts and surveys.
- [ ] Extend analytics dashboard to display A/B test results.
- [ ] Add UI indicators for test participation.

**Notes:**
- Use feature flags and random assignment for A/B tests.
- Ensure ethical and transparent testing practices.

### **Story 5: Accessibility and Usability Enhancements**

**User Story:**  
As a user with diverse needs, I want the Business Operations Hub to be accessible and easy to use, so I can accomplish my goals efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The platform meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
- Key workflows are optimized for keyboard and screen reader use.
- Usability improvements are made based on user feedback and analytics.
- Accessibility is tested and documented.

**Engineering Tasks:**
- [ ] Conduct accessibility audit and address issues.
- [ ] Improve keyboard navigation and ARIA labeling.
- [ ] Refine UI/UX for clarity and efficiency.
- [ ] Document accessibility features and compliance.

**Notes:**
- Prioritize high-impact accessibility fixes.
- Engage users with accessibility needs for feedback.
