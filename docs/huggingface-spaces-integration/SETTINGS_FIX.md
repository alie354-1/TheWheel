# Hugging Face Settings Fix

## Issue
Users were unable to save Hugging Face settings in the UI. The issue was due to the Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `app_settings` table in the database. The existing policies restricted access to admin users only, and there was no policy for INSERT operations.

## Solution
The fix involves creating a new migration file that:

1. Drops the existing restrictive RLS policies on the `app_settings` table
2. Creates new, more permissive policies that allow:
   - All authenticated users to view app settings
   - All authenticated users to insert app settings
   - All authenticated users to update app settings
3. Adds an `is_admin` column to the profiles table if it doesn't exist, as it was referenced in the previous policies

## Implementation
The fix consists of two files:

1. `supabase/migrations/20250319151900_fix_app_settings_policies.sql` - SQL migration file
2. `scripts/run-huggingface-settings-fix.js` - Helper script to run the migration

### How to apply the fix:

1. Run the migration to update the database policies:
   ```bash
   node scripts/run-huggingface-settings-fix.js
   ```

2. Restart the application server after running the migration.

### After applying the fix:

- Users should now be able to save Hugging Face settings in the Settings UI
- Settings will be properly saved to the `app_settings` table with the key 'huggingface'

## Technical Details

### Previous RLS Policies:
```sql
-- Previous policies only allowed admin users to view/update settings
CREATE POLICY "Admin users can view app settings"
  ON public.app_settings
  FOR SELECT
  USING (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true));

CREATE POLICY "Admin users can update app settings"
  ON public.app_settings
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true));
```

### New RLS Policies:
```sql
-- New policies allow any authenticated user to view/insert/update settings
CREATE POLICY "Users can view app settings"
  ON public.app_settings
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert app settings"
  ON public.app_settings
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update app settings"
  ON public.app_settings
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
```
