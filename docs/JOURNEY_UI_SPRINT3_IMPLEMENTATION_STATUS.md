## Technical Debt and Optimizations

1. Need to optimize rendering performance for large journey maps
2. Need to implement proper error boundaries for recommendation components
3. Consider implementing virtualization for large step lists

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Completed all Sprint 3 components
2. Begin implementation of the feedback collection system (Sprint 4)
3. Conduct user testing with the new components
4. Implement advanced visualization features (Sprint 4)
5. Address technical debt and optimizations identified during development
6. Perform performance testing with large datasets

## Notes

The recommendation system is now significantly more sophisticated, using multiple factors for scoring:
- Prerequisite completion (0-3 points)
- Industry relevance (0-2 points)
- Common next step patterns (0-2.5 points)
- Company stage relevance (0-1.5 points)
- Business model alignment (0-1 point)
- Similar company patterns (0-2 points)
- Focus area alignment (0-1.5 points)
- Time constraint compatibility (0-1 point)

This provides a much more personalized experience than the previous version, which only considered basic prerequisites and industry averages.
