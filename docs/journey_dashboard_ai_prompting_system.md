# Journey Dashboard AI Prompting System

## Overview

This document details the AI prompting system for the Journey Dashboard, focusing on how we'll generate personalized recommendations, peer insights, and business health analyses using OpenAI. The system is designed to create content that feels authentic, relevant, and helpful to founders at different stages of their journey.

## AI Content Categories

The system will generate three primary types of content:

1. **Step Recommendations**: Suggesting next steps based on company progress and peer behavior patterns
2. **Peer Insights**: Generating authentic-sounding founder perspectives relevant to the user's current challenges
3. **Business Health Analysis**: Assessing domain maturity and suggesting focus areas

## Contextualization System

### 1. Context Assembly Process

The system assembles relevant context for each prompt from multiple data sources:

1. **Company Data Pipeline**
   - Company profile information
   - Current progress status
   - Recent activity logs
   - Domain maturity levels
   - Completed and in-progress steps

2. **Industry Benchmarks Pipeline**
   - Typical progression patterns for this industry
   - Common maturity levels at this stage
   - Step completion statistics

3. **Peer Patterns Pipeline**
   - Steps commonly taken by similar companies
   - Typical challenges at this stage
   - Success patterns from similar companies

### 2. Context Filtering

To keep prompts focused and relevant:

1. **Relevance Filtering**
   - Include only the most relevant peer data
   - Filter step data to focus on current and potential next steps
   - Prioritize recent activity over historical data

2. **Detail Management**
   - Use detailed context for high-impact recommendations
   - Use summarized context for less critical content
   - Balance specificity with prompt length constraints

3. **Security & Privacy**
   - Remove all personally identifiable information
