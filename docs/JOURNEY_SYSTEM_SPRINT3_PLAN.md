# Journey System Sprint 3 Plan: Main Journey Page Implementation
**Date:** May 3, 2025  
**Status:** Draft  
**Target Completion:** June 13, 2025

## Overview

Sprint 3 builds on the foundation established in the first two sprints:

- **Sprint 1:** Data model consolidation, service layer refactoring
- **Sprint 2:** Core UI components (SimplePhaseProgress, JourneyOverview)

This sprint focuses on implementing the main Journey page with timeline and list views, incorporating the new unified data model and reusable components.

## Objectives

1. Implement the complete main Journey page
2. Create both Timeline and List views with seamless switching
3. Develop the Action Panel with personalized recommendations
4. Build the Step Panel with preview functionality
5. Implement state management for all Journey views

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Main Journey Page
- Complete responsive layout with adaptive views
- Integration with the unified journey data model
- Consistent design system implementation
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### 2. Timeline & List Views
- Timeline View:
  - Horizontal, scrollable timeline visualization
  - Phase grouping with visual separators
  - Variable card heights based on step importance
  - Click interactions for step selection

- List View:
  - Vertical list with collapsible phase sections
  - Detailed step information with status indicators
  - Sorting and filtering capabilities
  - Quick action buttons for each step

### 3. Action Panel
- Personalized recommendations based on company progress
- Smart filtering controls
- Next best action suggestions
- Quick links to relevant tools and resources

### 4. Step Panel
- Expandable preview of selected step details
- Quick actions without leaving the main page
- Tool preview with key information
- Status update capabilities

### 5. State Management
- Context-based state management for selected steps/phases
- Efficient data loading patterns
- Caching strategies for performance
- Optimistic UI updates

## Technical Approach

### Component Architecture

```
JourneyPage (Container)
├── JourneyHeader
│   ├── PhaseNavigation 
│   └── ViewToggle (Timeline/List)
├── MainSection
│   ├── TimelineView | ListView (toggleable)
│   │   └── StepCard[]
│   │       ├── StatusBadge
│   │       ├── DifficultyIndicator
│   │       └── TimeEstimate
│   └── ActionPanel
│       ├── NextRecommendations
│       └── FilterControls
└── StepPreviewPanel (expandable)
    ├── StepQuickView
    ├── ActionButtons
    └── ToolPreview
```

### State Management Approach

1. **Journey Context**
   - Selected phase
   - Selected step
   - View mode (timeline/list)
   - Filter settings

2. **Custom Hooks**
   - `useJourneyNavigation` - Handle navigation between phases/steps
   - `useStepSelection` - Manage step selection state
   - `useViewToggle` - Toggle between timeline and list views
   - `useStepRecommendations` - Get personalized recommendations

### Data Flow

1. Data fetched from unified service layer
2. Loaded into context providers
3. Components consume context through hooks
4. UI updates based on state changes
5. User interactions trigger state updates
6. Service layer persists changes when needed

## Tasks & Timeline

### Week 1 (June 2 - June 6)

1. **Layout Structure** (2 days)
   - Implement responsive page layout
   - Create header with phase navigation
   - Build view toggle mechanism

2. **Timeline View** (3 days)
   - Develop horizontal timeline visualization
   - Implement phase grouping in timeline
   - Create scrolling and interaction behaviors

### Week 2 (June 9 - June 13)

3. **List View** (2 days)
   - Build vertical list with phase sections
   - Implement step cards with detailed information
   - Add sorting and filtering capabilities

4. **Action Panel** (1.5 days)
   - Create recommendation engine integration
   - Build filtering controls
   - Implement next action suggestions

5. **Step Preview Panel** (1.5 days)
   - Build expandable step preview
   - Create quick actions interface
   - Implement tool preview component

### Stretch Goals (if time permits)

- Drag and drop functionality for reordering steps
- Enhanced visualization options for the timeline
- Advanced filtering mechanisms
- Animation enhancements for transitions

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Use virtualized lists for large datasets
- Implement lazy loading for step details
- Optimize API queries with pagination and filtering
- Cache frequently accessed data in memory

### Accessibility

- Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactions
- Implement proper ARIA attributes for custom controls
- Test with screen readers
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG requirements

### Mobile Optimization

- Create responsive layouts that adapt to small screens
- Implement touch-friendly interactions
- Simplify views for mobile without removing functionality
- Test on various screen sizes

## Dependencies

- Unified data model from Sprint 1
- UI components from Sprint 2 (especially SimplePhaseProgress and JourneyOverview)
- Design system integration
- API endpoints for journey data
- Recommendation engine integration

## Testing Strategy

1. **Component Tests**
   - Unit tests for each new component
   - Snapshot tests for UI stability
   - Interaction tests for user flows

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test component integration
   - Verify data flow
   - Test state management

3. **E2E Tests**
   - Test key user flows
   - Verify data persistence
   - Cross-browser testing

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Timeline view complexity | High | Medium | Start early, break into smaller components |
| Performance issues with large datasets | High | Medium | Implement virtualization and pagination |
| Mobile responsiveness challenges | Medium | Low | Mobile-first development approach |
| State management complexity | Medium | Medium | Clear data flow documentation, thorough testing |
| API integration issues | Medium | Low | Mock APIs for development, close work with backend team |

## Success Criteria

1. Main Journey page fully implemented with both Timeline and List views
2. Action panel with working recommendations
3. Step preview panel with functional quick actions
4. State management handling all user interactions
5. Performance meets established metrics (< 1s initial load, < 100ms interactions)
6. All components pass accessibility tests
7. Mobile experience fully functional

## Next Steps

Upon successful completion of Sprint 3, the team will move to Sprint 4, which focuses on:
- Step details page with tabs
- Tool selection and comparison
- Tool evaluation workflow
- Custom tool addition
- Integration with recommendation engine
